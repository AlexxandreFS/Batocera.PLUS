21-10-99:

20-10-99:

19-10-99:

- Added Makai Densetsu.
- Merged blood bros and west story, added rotation support.
- Added good Chuka Taisen roms.
- Added arkanoid 2 japanese, not sure what gfx roms it should have because
  they weren't included (ark2us or arkanoi2)?

18-10-99:

17-10-99:

16-10-99:

15-10-99:

14-10-99:

13-10-99:

12-10-99:

- Added Land Maker (r0x j00).
- Added Snow Bros (Japanese).
- Added Prime Time Fighter (it's the same game as top ranking stars, you can
  already play it via romswitch, but this incomplete dump has different code
  roms, not sure why - maybe taito made some bug fixes. btw, there should be
  no 's' after 'fighter').
- Renamed Legend of Makaj -> Legend of Makai.

11-10-99:

- Added rotation support to NMK games.
- Added rotation support to UPL games.
- Added rotation support to Snow Bros and clones.
- Added rotation options to gui:

  -rotate [angle] (angle is 0,90,180,270)
  -r [angle]      (angle is 0,90,180,270)
  -ror            (mame - means rotate 90 (ie. right))
  -rol            (mame - means rotate 270 (ie. left))

- Added -norotate. In mame, it disables game default rotations, so I guess it
  is useful for some people? 48 games are rotatable now...

10-10-99:

- Added Snow Bros (alternate 2). Malcor's set, differences in the 68k roms, and
  single gfx rom but no noticable game changes...
- Added rotation support to tnzs-system games.
- Added rotation support to x-system games.

09-10-99:

08-10-99:

- Fixed Exzisus (the other bits).
- Fixed Chase HQ sound? (well, it has an engine noise anyway).
- Added some rotation support. Only available for toaplan 1 games, and I'm not
  going to allow *all* games to be rotated because:

  a) it means everything that touches the game bitmap has to check for
     rotation, this is slow
  b) the above also means you need 4 routines - one for each rotation,
     this makes the exe bigger, and the code longer
  c) why would anyone want to rotate horizontal games?
  d) only a minority of people need this option

  So, I'll occasionally increase the rotatable games, but it's low priority :).
- Added rotation support to toaplan 2 games.

07-10-99:

- Yaaay!! Exzisus works (a bit). It's a tough one because it has 4 z80s... :).
- Fixed Exzisus (a bit).

06-10-99:

05-10-99:

- Replaced roms/ziprom paths, now there are 4 paths, which are used for *both*
  roms and ziproms (instead of 3 for zipped, 3 for unzipped).
- Changed screenshot names. Now they are gamename_nnn.pcx. Yes, they are 'long'
  file names, if this is *really* a problem, let me know and I will shorten them.

04-10-99:

- Some road fixes.

03-10-99:

- Cleaned some code, added current_game (pointer to current game, oddly enough).
- Added Continental Circus (alternate). This is Al's set, the (c) date is 1987
  and that is the only difference I saw. I think Al's set is correct, because
  1987 matches with "B33". The dump.it set says 1989 and is possibly an early
  release with a mistake :). If not, maybe they delayed the release 2 years??

02-10-99:

- Added cloneof support (it's kinda misplaced, cos it's just a variation of romof,
  which goes in the dir lists - should move them somewhere else some day). Cloneof
  is only useful for rom merge tools, and startraine wants it... it has no use in
  raine though "_".
- Added all the known toaplan and taito board numbers (probably).

01-10-99:

- Added board numbers to some games, made some [g]awk programs to help.

30-09-99:

29-09-99:

28-09-99:

27-09-99:

- The other thing Ghox has is protected hiscore code (code read from sound cpu
  and executed in ram). Works without it, but the hiscore table is messed up.
- Fixed sprites on Ghox game end.

26-09-99:

- Added Ghox. Protected sound, which is like whoopee/teki paki. Maybe we can
  find a Ghox bootleg (dump.it?). The protection does other things, dont know
  what, but it works without it so far... The game kicks arkanoid returns ass!
  What's a paddle controller? It looks like it moves only in one axis, and a
  joystick controls vertical movement? This seems like a silly idea, so I made
  some hacks to use mouse y for vertical movement...

25-09-99:

24-09-99:

23-09-99:

- Added an option to save individual game display settings, but I don't like it
  (use save_game_screen_settings in raine.cfg).

22-09-99:

- Added Chase HQ 2 (alternate). Al Kossow's set, 3 different roms.
- Added Kuri Kinton (alternate). This appears to be an update because it has
  a better title screen and a test mode. The other set is possibly from a
  preview or prototype board.

21-09-99:

- Fixed f3 games loadgame bug (actually an object layer toggle bug).
- Since people are going to play gun lock and grid seeker, we better release
  a bugfix for the above problem (which crashes your pc).

20-09-99:

19-09-99:

18-09-99:

17-09-99:

16-09-99:

15-09-99:

14-09-99:

13-09-99:

- Added Nastar. I think it's really a bad dump, because the code is identical,
  there is only 3 bytes changed and the rom switch byte :(.
- Added Darius alternate. It's got a few extra sprites and some more code roms.

12-09-99:

11-09-99:

- Fixed up Kuri Kinton. Improved gfx fg0 cache since tile#0 is not blank in this
  game.
- Fixed up priorities in toaplan#2 games (er, hopefully they are right).
- Recompile a least 10 times, followed by release, followed by bugfix release!

10-09-99:

- Added GUI bg_image option to raine.cfg.
- Fixed some things in Daisenpu (and other games).

09-09-99:

- Added Chuka Taisen. Looks like Insector X. B44.01 - B44.08 are probably bad,
  look like they are dumped too small (should be 128kb roms).

08-09-99:

- Fixed Kiki Kai Kai monks picking up boat, speed hacks and interrupt problem.

07-09-99:

- Added Ark Area. Ripped the better UPL logo for use in game info.
- Oops, still need the roms for snowbroj (Snow Bros Japanese).
- Started Quiz Crayon 2. "Dum de dum de dum, dum de dum de dum...".

06-09-99:

- Some NGPC experiments.
- Added Daisenpu.

05-09-99:

- Added Cadash French. Fixed something I forgot when changing cadashit rom names.
- Fixed something I forgot when changing rastsaga rom names.
- Added Rastan American (rastanu) and Rastan American (alternate) (rastanu2).

04-09-99:

03-09-99:

- Changed a few rom names in cadashit and rastsaga to simplify single-zip merging.
- Changed romcheck output and added a -verbose option to the command line.

02-09-99:

01-09-99:

- Added Richard Mitton's ksystem.c update with knight boy! Only two roms are diff
  and they are both gfx, so I expect the only difference is in the title screen.
- Added Richard Mitton's 320x256 mode-x mode.
- Added Kageki. It's very average, there is a adpcm chip, which I didn't add yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Win32/Direct-X Main Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Set palette is being slow/forces vsync (problem with windows gfx drivers/d-x?)
- Direct-X Accelerated is not safe (problem with windows gfx drivers/direct-x?)
- Sound is slower and worse than dos (problem with seal? change to direct-x?)
- Various asm gfx routines are missing (eg. f3-system pixel layer)
- Rotation code is only in c, while the dos version has asm routines
- Triple Buffer is not available
- 68020 games don't work

  as the 68000 x-system, while tnzs-system is the z80 based x-system.

05-09-99:

- Added Cadash French. Fixed something I forgot when changing cadashit rom names.
- Fixed something I forgot when changing rastsaga rom names.
- Added Rastan American (rastanu) and Rastan American (alternate) (rastanu2).

04-09-99:

  and they are both gfx, so I expect the only difference is in the title screen.
- Added Richard Mitton's 320x256 mode-x mode.
- Waddayaknow, Kageki is tnzs hardware (i suspected when it said seta-x1 in the
  readme).
- Added Kageki. It's very average, there is a adpcm chip, which I didn't add yet.

31-08-99:

- Added remaining toaplan1 games (truxton, hell fire, fire shark, same same same).
- Intel asm files like emitted s68000/mz80 are now compiled by the makefile. The
  source is only 900kb rar now and the compiled dir is gone :).

30-08-99:

29-08-99:

28-08-99:

27-08-99:

- Added some more toaplan games, none are really playable yet, but the game count
  is now 200, and it's kinda funny :).

26-08-99:

- Added Spindizzy's Kiki Kai Kai driver, this game kicks ass now!! It's also very
  tough, so I had to make some cheats :).
- Added Bobble Bobble and Super Bobble Bobble (both bootlegs). There is also one
  called 'bublbobr' in mame, but I need the roms.
- Moved Viamana into toaplan1.c and made it work a bit (no controls).
- Added Vimana alternate set and Outzone (too bored to finish).

25-08-99:

- Changes to Quiz priorities.

24-08-99:

23-08-99:

22-08-99:

21-08-99:

- Updated raine.txt. Despite my attempts to quit/take a break, we have got a lot
  of new games ready, and it's only 3 weeks since the last version... :).
- Fixed American Horseshoes gfx banking.
- Added suport for using any pen for the white ingame messages. A few direct
  mapped games like American Horseshoes need it when pen 255 is already used.
- Tried to improve American Horseshoes controls. Very strange.

20-08-99:

- Removed some unused lines from makefile.
- Added c versions of most tile drawing (mac port requires them).

19-08-99:

- Fixed? Sound click at 44100Hz (seal? shit more like).
- Removed no longer used data from sasound and drivers (rec.sync was always 60,
  rec.count was always 2, rec.update was always NULL).
- Removed rec.stop. Added sound_chip_list[] in sasound.c.
- Start adding SOUND_INFO into game structs. Done YM2610 games.
- Changed all other games, removed old sasetsound/addsound() calls.

- I came back. Added the two new quiz games (not finished).
- Fixed stuff in quiz games. Still priorities to fix in the last three.

12-08-99:

11-08-99:

10-08-99:

09-08-99:

08-08-99:

- Change Cachat crc32 data (new roms work fine).
- Added Yuyu no quiz de gogo. Not finished yet, the text doesn't show up.
- accept 'raine <gamename>' on the command line (preferred use is 'raine -game
  <gamename>').

07-08-99:

- Fixed bug in new cpumain.c context switching.
- Made pixel double much faster for linear display modes.
- Same thing for eagle.
- Made pixel double and eagle mode only used in linear modes.

06-08-99:

- Fixed up tnzsb.
- Made cheats per game limit 256.
- Ripped config file routines from allegro, because the standard allegro ones
  are getting too slow for the big cheat files.

05-08-99:

04-08-99:

03-08-99:

- Made Snow Bros compatible with mame roms and added the other set.
- Added Teki Paki. Hardware like Whoopee, but no sound cpu dumped (remember,
  Whoopee uses the bootleg z80 rom for sound...).
- Fixed sound problem with some dual YM2203 games.

02-08-99:

- Made dogyuun run. This game looks kickass, like fix eight... yikes!
- Changed toaplan YM2151 to 3.58MHz.
- Made Dogyuun playable, no sound.

01-08-99:

- Added bombjack twin dipswitches, thx mirko.
- Argh, starscream 0.26 breaks music looping in bombjack twin.
- Fixed immediate interrupt calling, so it should work like the old starscream.
- Added cachat. heh, there are 2 bad gfx roms: cac8, cac10. but it's playable
  anyway.
- Yikes, dogyuun has the same protected subcpu as fixeight. Custom toaplan
  ts-001-turbo :(.
- Replaced a lot of s68000 and mz80 calls with calls to generic cpu routines.
- Fixed a bug that could cause darius2d to crash on startup.

31-07-99:

- yikes, what to put in the release? i'm not sure about gekirindan (emulation
  is too lousy for my liking), chimera beast (i think j-rom wants it released
  in raine first, or does he?). So, I'm going to hide these three in the exe.

Add these to raine.cfg:

[arcade_roms_from_japan]
#enable chimera beast
jrom_rules = 12345

[romlist]
#enable gekirindan
aracorn_rox_j00 = 67890

- Release!

30-07-99:

- found starscream 0.25+ bug that makes you get stuck in the castle in cadash.
- added starscream 0.26a. Seems to work, but I feel the new interrupt system
  might break some games... Didn't find any yet though.
- improved the way starscream cpu's are saved, so it can be expanded for future
  versions.
- bubble bobble mcu registers are saved. hmm, we could do with changing this
  a bit, so there is an mcu 'emulator' which can run other mcu recompiliations.
- fixed snow bros 2 and tatsujin 2 with no sound selected.
- changed bubble bobble bankswitching.
- in knuckle bash, the sound cpu is probably a protected z80 (kbash02.bin).
- improved some bits of chase hq.
- fixed some of the chimera beast priorities.

29-07-99:

- added chimera beast.

28-07-99:

- Added Super Cup Final. The D34-xx roms are not used (part of riding fight).
  The 256kb roms should all be 128kb (just cut the end off).
- Added better support for rom sharing/merging.
- If a rom is not found, it will search for it in the parent game, and if a rom
  is not found in the parent game, it will check the parent game to see if the
  rom is merged with a different filename (by searching for matching crc32 and
  size data).

27-07-99:

- Fixed operation Wolf 3 a bit.
- Cut Darius 2 Dual Screen roms that were too large. The crc32 data also changes.
- Cut Operation Wolf 3 roms that were too large. The crc32 data also changes.
- Added Hat Trick Hero 95. It is a differnt football game, also the gfx and sample
  roms are all corrupt!!
- Removed D49-xx roms from Puzzle Bobble 2, these are part of Cup Final.
- Updated board list. Puzzle Bobble is not D94, it's E10, like Puzzle Bobble 2x.
- Updated board list. 'Hat Trick Hero 95' has a romswitch for 'Taito Power Goal'.
- Just realised I have an aracorn dump of Power Goal here! WTF?? When did I get
  that??!? Duh... :).
- Replaced Hat Trick Hero 95 roms with power goal. But I left the default switch
  to hat trick hero 95 (probably more well known under this name).

26-07-99:

- Yep, Exzisus has an MCU (which is undumped, btw).

25-07-99:

24-07-99:

- Fixed Cadash Japanese. Removed Japanese romswitches from other versions, since
  they are bad (only Japanese version has the japanese text data).
- Possibly fixed Cadash sometimes missing music.

23-07-99:

- Added Quiz HQ. Made some screenshots while testing.
- Added Dynamite League adpcm rom. Now there is some speech, drums, etc... :).
- Added 64th Street Japanese.
- Added Darius 2 dual screen version.
- Added Spindizzy's Bubble Bobble driver, and fixed it so it runs... :).
- It was a good day for adding games!

22-07-99:

- Added led emulation to Darius, Warrior Blade.
- Fixed rotational games, due to previous changed messing it up. I think the are
  the last messed up games...
- Added the arcade monitor settings to raine.cfg.

21-07-99:

- Merged Darius 2 with Ninja Warriors. Fixed screen size and scroll offsets due
  to previous change messing it up.

20-07-99:

- Added screen size in VIDEO_INFO struct, and removed SetScreenBitmap(). Now the
  screen size can be dumped, but some games are messed up by this change.
- Fixed MS-1, due to above change.
- Fixed Terra Cresta, Armed Formation.
- Some extra colours in gui. Also made the default colours a bit less washed out.
- tripple_buffer became triple_buffer (oops).

19-07-99:

- A bad, bad day...

18-07-99:

- Fixed up Quiz Torimonochou (gfx, dsw, inputs, everything else). Screenshots &
  html.
- Exzisus looks like it has an mcu... Unfortunately there is no readme with the
  romset :(.

17-07-99:

- Made some zip/rar archives for Richard Mitton and maybe Richard Bannister
  (it's not in a state to port to mac os, so I dunno...).
- Hmm, Liquid Kids joystick is fine for me... Mario, check your config files.

16-07-99:

- Cheat info lines can be edited in the gui like the other cheat data.
- Moved [General] -> LanguageFile is now [Directories] -> language_file.
- Added [Directories] -> cheat_file.
- Added Cheat patch type, but it has no functionality yet.
- Added different cheat patch types, but I haven't tested them.
- Fixed some possible gui crashes with listboxes.
- Tested some of the new cheat types.

15-07-99:

- Balloon Bros looks really crap. Sound hardware by taito, video hardware by
  Seta. Also a c-chip!! Now what do they need a c-chip for?
- Balloon Bros is basically a Tetris clone, but with the blocks moving *up*
  the screen... So, it's just about worth adding :).
- Yikes! Guess what?... Part of the Seta video hardware is basically the same as
  the tnzs-system and superman video hardware... Hmmm...
- Thanks to Glenn Hagon, I now have another 2 16mb simms. Now my pc has 64mb! =).
- Merged Superman and Balloon Bros.
- Changed something in tc0140syt emulation, to fix Balloon Bros. However, it is
  possible this breaks other games, so now they need play testing.
- Added Object and BG double buffer to tnzs-system, balloon bros & Superman. Now
  the sprites move a lot better in Insector X, Extermination and Balloon Bros.
- Moved all the gfx emulation for Tnzs-System, Balloon Bros and Superman into
  setax1.c/h. I am going to call it seta x1, because there are 3 seta x1-00??
  chips listed in the balloon bros readme.

14-07-99:

13-07-99:

- Added the 320x240 arcade monitor mode from brian lewis... It should work fine,
  maybe he has some more resolutions for it too...
- Changed the screen selector, so that the list of resolutions changes depending
  on what gfx driver is highlighted. For example, it only shows 320x200 for VGA,
  only shows possible resolutions for mode-x, only shows 320x240 for arcade
  monitor... Now it is easy to see which resolutions are possible for each
  driver :).

12-07-99:

- Readd better key names, since I lost the source by accident!!
- Yikes! Many games use a 'table' mode for 2 players, so I need to check a lot
  of game dsw, and make sure they are set to 'upright' by default. For example,
  try running raimais or puzznic in 2 player mode.

11-07-99:

- Added Palamedes :).
- Fixed something I forgot to change in 8x8 tile flipping. It was causing some
  sprite problems in L-System games (Champion Wrestler, Palamedes, and probably
  all the others too).
- Added rom versions and leds to Palamedes.
- Added year info to the remaining games.
- Removed a crashing problem in RaineX. It seems translation file routines are
  bugged in allegro, so it might cause some other gui crashing in the port.
- Added more buttons to the allegro direct-x joystick driver... There was a bug,
  and pressing buttons over 8, would freeze up the game. If they don't notice it,
  I better point it out to them...

10-07-99:

- Added year info to about 40 more games. Boring.
- Added rom loading by crc32 (zipped only, but mame is the same).

09-07-99:

- Yikes, need to write an M6585 emulator for Grand Cross music (not even mame has
  one).
- Made an M6585 emulator :). It's a sucky adpcm playback chip.
- Replaced 'strcasecmp' with the portable name 'stricmp'.
- Added year info to about 50 games.

08-07-99:

- Added Objects to Grand Cross emulation. Added priority. Added new control
  defaults for pinball games (but I doubt we will get many more in raine):

 { KEY_LCONTROL,0x00,		"Def Flipper 1 Left",	},
 { KEY_RCONTROL,0x00,		"Def Flipper 1 Right",	},
 { KEY_LSHIFT,	0x00,		"Def Flipper 2 Left",	},
 { KEY_RSHIFT,	0x00,		"Def Flipper 2 Right",	},
 { 86,		0x00,		"Def Tilt Left",	},
 { KEY_SLASH,	0x00,		"Def Tilt Right",	},
 { KEY_Z,	0x00,		"Def Button 1 Left",	},
 { KEY_STOP,	0x00,		"Def Button 1 Right",	},

  I did not choose any default joystick settings yet, not sure what will work
  best...

- Improved key names a bit (eg. 'minus' becomes '-', 'stop' becomes '.').

07-07-99:

- Played Gameboy Color (Pokemon Pinball), and I remembered how cool pinball games
  can be, so I tried adding Grand Cross Pinball to raine.
- Fixed some stuff on Grand Cross.

06-07-99:

- Removed some no longer used tile routines.
- I'm too bored with everything, including this emulator.
- Added -gameinfo option, prints info for games in a shark/mame syntax useful for
  frontend authors.

05-07-99:

- Added LED emulation to Tatsujin 2, Snow Bros 2, Whoopee, Knuckle Bash.

04-07-99:

- Added Cadash Japanese, since the code roms are very slightly different. The
  Japanese text looks just like in the normal version with romswitch, and I think
  there is a problem to fix here (eg. the name select is missing characters).
- Added an mmx tile routine, for stuff like l-system... But it did not give any
  speed increase, so I commented it out.
- Removed some unnecessary push %ebp lines in direct mapped tiles.

03-07-99:

- M72 is almost 60fps on my new pc, but it was not even playable before... Must
  be something to do with mmx...

02-07-99:

- Hello! After 5 hours of work, I got all the stuff from my old pc inserted into
  the atx case, yipee!!! =)). madmax1 & nemesis1 r0x j0o!!. At first it didn't
  work, because the jumpers were set for a p2-266, doh. Another mistake, I made
  was to plug the floppy cable in the wrong way (on the floppy end).. oops! One
  more mistake - I plugged the led cables in the wrong way round, but there was
  no info on which way was right :).
- Tested some emus, the frameskip on p47 in mame, is *only* 7-8 now, lol, I was
  expecting it to run at 60fps :). Anyway, stuff like neorage runs about 60fps,
  and zsnes too (zsnes seems like a totally new emulator when playing some of
  the games).
- Possibly made Toaplan gfx emulation faster, hard to tell when I just changed
  cpu's... Playing Tatsujin 2 at 60fps rules!
- Flashed a new bios for the mainboard, which I downloaded a while ago, when I
  received the package from nemesis1.

01-07-99:

- Fixed a bit Fix Eight.
- I don't think I can do any more on fix eight without a bootleg, or unprotected
  set. Shame we have zero active rom dumpers left :(.
- Backed up Raine source, incase I destroy my pc when upgrading it (heh, I'm not
  very confident).

30-06-99:

- Order an aopen midi atx case... ˙40, but ˙50 with vat+postage... Things are
  more expensive in the UK... :(.
- Downloaded Allegro 3920, which claims to add joystick support for the direct-x
  port.
- Compiled Allegro 3920, updated raine joystick list, joysticks work in rainex,
  atleast my sidewinder does... :).

29-06-99:

28-06-99:

- Fixed unzipped games appearing as missing in gui with msvc.
- Replace ADSAMPLE in m6295.c/h with smaller struct called M6295_SAMPLE.
- Added 16 bit streamed sample replay, changes nichibutsu & cabal, so the play
  sample routines are not used now (everything uses sound streaming).

27-06-99:

- Added Extermination, quite easy, just combine bits from tnzs and arkanoid 2.
- Romcheck and gamelist are output to the screen instead of in files now...
  Well, it's probably more useful like that for most people, and I guess most
  people also know how to redirect output to a file.
- It seems you can also add dejap.dat to the end of rainex.exe (good) :).
- Rearranged some code, moved main emulation loops from raine.c into emumain.c.
- In no gui mode, the tab key will reactivate the gui (req. by Bubble).

26-06-99:

- Fixed Puchi Carat running too fast.
- Added Trackball control to Arkanoid Returns and Puchi Carat. Enter the test
  mode to enable it (or delete the eeprom images in savedata).
- Made Fix Eight run more. The protection handles input, sound and much of the
  game gfx.

25-06-99:

- Coin Inputs are now only active for 250ms when you press them. This should fix
  most 'Coin Error' problems in Taito games (caused by holding the coin buttons
  too long).
- Moved a bunch of stuff into GAME_MAIN. Also moved everything from GAME into
  GAME_MAIN. Boring, horrible task, when it had to be done for all 168 games...
- Changed rainex main config file to rainex.cfg. So there should be no problems
  running raine and rainex in the same dir(s).

24-06-99:

- Tried 2 sidewinders, and it works on my brother's pc and on my pc...
- Tried to improve rdtsc profile, because the percentages did not add up to 100%
  on my brother's pc. didn't get a chance to see if I fixed it yet.
- Fixed 8x8 and 16x16 direct mapped tile drawing to work on rainex. Now L-System
  games have correct gfx. Actually, they also became a bit faster for the dos
  version too :).
- Fixed Ingame text drawing to work in rainex.
- Removed audio update calls in rainex, since seal says they are not needed for
  windows.

23-06-99:

- Argh, DirectX 6.1 is working very badly on my pc...
  1) 320x200/320x240 8-bit resolutions do not work (corrupt display)
  2) The DirectX setpalette function seems to force vsync, but it's not supposed
     to do that
  3) The same problems are shown also when I run system16dx and neoragex in 8bit
     modes. don't know how to fix.
- Downloaded proper Diamond gfx driver for my card. Now 320x? works, but 400x300
  is not allowed anymore... And the palette is still forcing a vsync :(.
- Changed 68020 core, so all the opcodes are single filed (a020core.c/o/oa).
  It is included precompiled in the compiled dir, so that msvc can use it. 

22-06-99:

- Added lots of warning/error fixes and #ifdef RAINE_DOS, some of raine compiles
  ok in msvc. It's using the msvc/win32 versions of allegro and seal for now...
- 'Fixed' all compiling errors, so it now gets to the linking stage in msvc...
  But there are 3000 link errors to 'fix' now... heh.
- Yikes! Now all the errors are fixed and it actually compiles, links and runs!!
  Amazing!!! Ok, I only ran it once, and didn't manage to load a game, but the
  gui was usable =).
- Just played Bomb Jack Twin in Raine-X... :)... It didn't crash, I even turned
  the sound on, and that worked too!! lol.

21-06-99:

- Got another copy of mscv5.0 from Mario, also direct-x 6.1 sdk, and I only had
  5.0 before... :). Thanks man!. Btw, these cd's take a lot of attempts before
  they are recognized, someone told me the problem might be solved if you burn
  them at a lower speed? Maybe the colour is not the real cause?...
- Compiled Allegro 3918 for msvc... Maybe the port will use allegro, maybe not.
  I will start using it, since it should be less work. Then maybe remove allegro
  from the port later on. Or maybe not... heh. Or.. maybe.. possibly.. not sure.
- Started making changes to raine source, to make it compile with msvc. Ofcourse
  it just comes up with 1000's of error and warning messages, mostly due to
  inline asm, which all has to be changed in msvc.

20-06-99:

- Amuse source is *very* interesting:

  These look like being TNZS-System:

     B19 = DR.TOPPEL TANKENTAI (c)KANEKO / TAITO 1987

19-06-99:

- Made Super Chase start running.
- Heh, I can only compile simple stuff with msvc, it's a bit wierd to use at
  the moment, so I probably need some time to understand it better :).

18-06-99:

- 4 cd-r's arrived from Pincushion Man (Chuck). Now I am attempting to compile
  some simple code with msvc5.0 :)...

17-06-99:

- Super Chase is almost certainly Chase HQ 3. It's not normal F3-System, it's
  more advanced, like Under Fire. 68020+68000+OTIS+68000.
- I am unable to install monyons' RCEdit Beta. One of the .ocx files won't
  register, I don't know much about windows, so I don't know how to solve it.
- Added a couple more Combatribes dsw (thx mayuga).
- Added a bit Super Chase.

16-06-99:

- Moved all the road layer code into tc150rod.c/h.
- Found some dsw for Chase HQ 2.
- Found some dsw for Continental Circus.
- Finished Conintental Circus controls, now it's playable, and more fun that I
  was expecting ;).
- Added PSX pad driver. Added #define's around all joystick driver references, so
  raine can be compiled when some joystick drivers are missing from allegro.

15-06-99:

- Fixed stuff in Chase HQ 2, actually it's not protected, it just has annoying
  interrupts and where it communicates with the motorized chair looked like
  an mcu (but it's not protection) :).

14-06-99:

- Added Strahl, works fine (protected sound, like bio ship paladin?).

13-06-99:

- Added Combatribes player 3 controls and dsw to activate them (thx mayuga).
- Changed TNZS guide url in cheats.txt (thx chris).
- Release again!

12-06-99:

- Changed Frame Skip option in gui.
- Replaced Tripple Buffer scroll routines, so they (should) work with vbe/af.

11-06-99:

- Updated translation template.cfg (oops, forgot).

10-06-99:

- Fixed most sprite sync in Tatsujin 2.
- Fixed most priorities in Master of Weapons, Ashura Blaster.
- FG0 banking in B-System (eg. screen clear in Rambo 3, FBI logo in Violence Fight),

09-06-99:

- Fix some WGP stuff, it still isn't playing the actual game yet.
- Fix Taito Tetris romlist (some of the Rastan 2 roms are unused).
- Think we better make a 'sidewinder release' this weekend. Lots of mail about
  this, and it's fixed now I think.
- Added coin setting dsw to Violence Fight and fixed FBI logo.
- Fixed tripple buffer interfering with frame skip radio buttons in gui.

08-06-99:

- Time to test my sidewinder :).

07-06-99:

- Yay! I now have a Sidewinder Gamepad, thanks to Paul G. :))).
- Fixed Sidewinder in allegro (added a second copy of the code as sidewinder b).
  I only had to change one number to fix it, but I left the original sidewinder
  in allegro incase it's needed. From what I can tell, the 'sidewinder b' should
  function the same as the system16 driver...
- Fixed properly the password decode problem with datafile (last night was a hack
  to fix it).
- Added support for 12 buttons on each joystick. This is the current allegro max,
  my sidewinder has 10.
- Added new default joystick settings - button 9 = player start (this button is
  labelled 'start' on a sidewinder). button 10 = player coin slot (this button is
  the 'M' button below 'start' on a sidewinder). It's great, I can play on raine
  without leaning over the keyboard now =).
- Added Player 3 and 4 Controls in Snow Bros 2, Hit the Ice.
- Inproved Hit the Ice dsw info.
- Added WGP.

06-06-99:

- Changed Pulirula crc32 to aracorn's set.
- Changed bits of romcheck.txt to lower case (guru-choc).
- Hej, the final cd-r now worked :) Mame+Neogeo+Raine/Mario :). Slowly copying to
  my HD.
- Played a bunch of games in mame, hehe :).
- Tried to merge cheat files as best I can.
- Fixed some rom crc32 stuff from razoola.
- Fixed alignment of rom sizes in game info window.
- Fixed Sprite:BG0 Scroll Sync in Thunder Dragon.
- Release!!

05-06-99:

- Fixed Pop n Pop gfx in some ways.
- Fixed Chase HQ Tunnels in some ways.

04-06-99:

- Fixed Insector X collision on level 2.
- Renamed InsectrX to InsectX, since mame renamed the romset.
- Fixed buttons in Arkanoid 2.
- Fixed Reset Game in TNZS-System games.
- Renamed ninjakd2.c to upl.c.
- Fixed some bugs (Maze of Flott, Cleopatra's Fortune)...
- Fixed Don Doko Don crashing bug (bad romsw pointer).
- Replaced Year: 1988 in game info, until the data is added to the drivers.
- Resized Cheat list and DSW list to fit the text better.
- Resized new Cheat stuff, added extra edit boxes for cheat search byte:
  hex, decimal, signed decimal, ascii char.
- Fixed Silent Dragon running too fast. Fixed Silent Dragon FG0 tile banking.
- Fixed Silent Dragon scroll sync. Got rid of trash, but there is some on the
  last level.

03-06-99:

- Now one of Mario's cd-r's is recongized... Since the cd has no name, it is hard
  to tell when it is recognized by windoze (always says D:). I don't know why they
  work now, maybe my cd drive had some dust inside and it is gone now? Stange how
  this 'dust' only effected cd-r's though... Maybe it likes hot weather? :).
- Only one of Mario's cd-r's is recognized (the 100% neogeo one).
- Completed Puzzle De Pon-R, always wanted to do that :).

02-06-99:

- Found some cheats for bomb jack twin (testing the cheat search).
- Fixed Hex view *'s around matching bytes.

01-06-99:

- Hey! I inserted one of those cd-r's that my cd-rom won't recognize and it
  actually got recognized! :)). Console Roms/Razoola, copied to my HD.
- Also worked: N64-CPS2/Razoola, copied to my HD.
- Still not recognized: mario's cd-r's... :(.
- Play console games ;).

31-05-99:

- Added different cheat search methods. I tested them on Bubble Symphony and
  got some nice cheats, but then I lost them cos I managed to crash the game :).
  Anyway:

   SEARCH_MODE_ABSOLUTE - Searches for absolute byte values
 (old method, works)

   SEARCH_MODE_RELATIVE - Searches for differences between all bytes at the start
 (found tunder dragon lives correctly, should work ok)

 SEARCH_MODE_SINGLE_BIT - Searches for a single bit value
 (should work, but i didn't find much with it)

       SEARCH_MODE_SLOW - Searches for greater, less or equal values
 (works great for finding flags, found player bubble effects and stuff)

30-05-99:

- Added malcor's new Chase HQ Japanese sample rom :). Now both sets are 100%.
- Added full Thunder Dragon set (and fixed a crashing bug).
- Fixed a nasty bug that was causing fake eeproms to get saved for lots of games.

29-05-99:

- Fixed a bit chase hq road layer.
- Fixed a bit chase hq sprite priorites when they are hidden by a hill.
- Add hiroshi sasound, new mode still crashes ingame (eg. tnzs). Old mode seems
  to be ok...
- Fixed bug in scroll macros, was causing a missing tile in the top left corner
  of chase hq tile fades.

28-05-99:

27-05-99:

- Changed Rainbow Islands to 'mapped' mapping, screen draw takes about 10% more
  time on a p120, but it's ok, since vsync is never called.
- Converted all the other games.
- Fixed sprites in converted Mega Blast.
- Removed vsync autodetect option.
- Removed 80x80 and 160x120 from gfx mode select. Also removed Xteneded mode, I
  don't know what it is good for, it can only do 640x400.
- Removed any listed resolutions where Y < 200. You can still select these from
  raine.cfg, but it's probably not worth mentioning them, since no game will fit.
- Added tripple buffer as an option.

26-05-99:

- Made Thunder Dragon playable, using code hacks from bootleg.
- Fixed Thunder Dragon Title screen/hiscore screen/nmk logo, which are hacked
  to be disabled in the bootleg version.
- Made some fixes to Task Force Harrier and Hacha Mecha Fighter. It would probably
  be easy to fix HMF by burning some new roms and dumping the protection data
  onscreen.
- Made 'mapped' mapped games keep colours locked for 3 frames instead of 2, I
  think this is necessary for tripple buffer on some slow gfx cards. I noticed
  there is only 15 'direct' mapped games in raine now, so maybe I will convert
  them and then tripple bufferring will be ok in every game... They are only
  faster without vsync anyway, and I think many people use vsync on or autodetect
  in raine.
  Reasons to convert these games:

  1) can remove vysnc autodetect
  2) can remove about 50kb of code
  3) can support tripple buffer in all games

  Reasons to not convert them:

  1) lazy
  2) faster drawing, but this is wasted since they require vsync on or autodetect

25-05-99:

- Fixed input and dsw, so the they work again.
- Changed rom switches in a similar way to the input/dsw data.
- Keys now move around the load game list (eg. 's' to jump to saint dragon).
- Added Thunder Dragon (code protected, gfx missing).
- Added Thunder Dragon bootleg (gfx protected or corrupt).
- Fixed up Thunder Dragon bootleg. I'm pretty sure td_05.bin does not belong
  in this romset! It looks like gfx from West Story.

24-05-99:

- Examine how mame merged roms are loaded... It doesn't work when you unzip a
  merged romset(!) Unless you manually split up the merged set into seperate game
  dirs again :). Also, the zip dirnames (set1/ set2/ etc...) are not used, so I
  think they are using crc32's mainly to load the roms, otherwize it would fall
  over when set2 and set1 contain roms with the same name.
- Fixed P47 rom sharing for american version.
- Fixed Toki continue dsw.
- Changed how dsw and input data is stored in *every* game, very horrible and
  boring, but raine.exe became about 64kb smaller :).

23-05-99:

- Changed and moved rom check option, now you can type raine -romcheck to check all
  games, and raine -romcheck <gamename> to check a single game.
- Added crc32 info to task force harrier, fixed crc32 for final blow sample roms.
- Added mame tripple buffer scroll routine, but it's not going to work with the
  direct mapped code in raine...
- Rezipped all my raine roms...

22-05-99:

- Fixed rom checking to work with ziproms and all dir paths. Currently the rom
  check is stuck on the end of gamelist and it checks all roms, which takes a
  few mintues... Use raine -gamelist and then look at gamelist.txt.
- Added Sega ISA joystick driver. Does it work? Nobody knows... Hiroshi will
  need the segaisa.zip file to update allegro...
- Put directory strings into dir_cfg struct (see raine.h).
- Added Task Force Harrier, protected like HMF and BSP.

21-05-99:

- Fixed a bit Hacha Mecha Fighter, it's protected tho.
- Fixed Peek a Boo. No sound, no sound rom(s) dumped!(?).
- P47 Alpha contains some NMK copyrights, heh.

20-05-99:

- Add new Hiroshi sound sources:
  new update - still crashes on slow pc's (buffer write not clipped and trashes memory) :(.
  old update - sound is 'de-synced' a lot more than the old source?!
- In sound dir, placed new sources in new??????.zip and old sources in old??????.zip.
  It is easy to swap between them, just recompile everything in sound/*.o.
- Added memory view window when you double click on search results.
- Changed M6295 interface, now there is no limit on the number of rom banks,
  since Bomb Jack Twin has many rom banks.
- Added Bomb Jack Twin sound.

19-05-99:

- Fixed some file access stuff for the new dir accessing.
- 100% decoded the Bomb Jack Twin BG0 gfx! /me rox joo! :).
- Fixed stuff in Bomb Jack Twin, just needs sound now. Made screenshots and html.

18-05-99:

- Unzipped all my roms and dumped a list of all the file name/size/crc32 data.
- Put extra dir names and rom size/crc data in all the game drivers. That was
  so annoying and boring to do... Now the data is in there, but not being used
  yet.
- Fixed Chase HQ checksums (took checksum from the bad sample roms by accident).
- Changed rom load and game gist so they check the new multiple rom directory
  names.
- Expanded Load Error messages, they are in a scrollable text area and can be
  up to 64kb long.
- Fixed Darius Extra and Whoopee (can load roms from Darius and Pipi Bibi dirs).

17-05-99:

- 100% decoded the Bomb Jack Twin Sprite gfx! /me rox joo! :).
- Fixed some bits of Bomb Jack, moved NMK games out of megasys1.c, since the
  file was getting huge.
- Fixed Grid Seeker calling an illegal interrupt (stops crashing).
- Added Gekirindan.
- Changed Toki screen draw from asm to c. Now it is nice without vsync. Also:
  Added P2 Joystick (enable with dsw), added bg priority (toki logo), made
  bg scrolling in sync with sprites.
- Changed Snow Bros screen draw from asm to c. Now there are no more gamename.S
  files, which is probably a good thing. Made Snow Bros music 50% faster rate.
- Removed some stuff no longer needed now the asm screen drawing is gone.

16-05-99:

- Added good Chase HQ english sample roms, thanks Jim! :). All the roms are mapped
  correctly, but there is still the sample looping bug (press turbo and it goes
  "Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah etc......" heh).
- Fixed a recently added bug in applying action replay cheats.
- Stopped sample looping problem in Chase HQ. Z80 sends data back to 68000 when it
  finishes playing a voice, but the 68000 never reads it, so the Z80 re-reads it
  and re-plays the sample etc...
- Changed 68000 speeds to 16MHz in Chase HQ. The main cpu seemed like it was choking
  a bit on just 12Mhz...

15-05-99:

- Game list mode is saved in raine.cfg (requested by some ppl).
- Placed gui config data in a struct (rgui_cfg - defined in gui.h).
- Placed some display config data in a struct (display_cfg - defined in raine.h).
- Added fast_set_pal in raine.cfg. 1 = Use faster colour loading (raine 0.20).
  0 = Use slower colour loading (raine 0.18; compatible with more cards). Default
  is 1.
- Fixed a bit Bomb Jack Twin, infact the gfx roms may not be bad, they might be
  protected. Need to get my l33t ms-1 decoder source from Richard Mitton.
- Added Autofire setup in gui. It works well, try using a test mode (eg. mega blast)
  to test it out :). Autofire settings are not saved, should they be?
- Made raine look for dejap.dat in raine dir *before* looking for it appended to
  raine.exe. The reasons are:
  1) _iceball_ can test new gfx even when there is already an appended datafile.
  2) If we ever have the need, we can release an updated dejap.dat. Unlikely.
- Added an NMK logo to dejap.dat/game info screen.

14-05-99:

- Add 6 buttons in Kaiser Knuckle. Also, there is a 'blood mode' available in the
  eeprom config in the test mode :).
- Messed with the fonts and stuff, now gui uses 3 fonts:
  1) font for window titlebars (chars can be variable width)
  2) main gui font for everything (chars can be variable width)
  3) font for listboxes (chars must all be same width to keep columns in line)

13-05-99:

- I was (re)playing the Tales of Phantasia translation for the last few days.
  I've completed it now anyway :).
- Renamed dir omegaf to omega_fighter, to see if long file names work (they do).
  Also, checked to make sure long file names work with zips (they do too).
- Important note: if you have djgpp installed, you have to set LFN=y in djgpp.env
  to use long file names, same as with HVSids update tool...
- Hacked libc.a so LFN setting is ignored (replace 3C6E7513 with 3C6EEB13), should
  save a few 'bug' emails about long filename problems.

12-05-99:

11-05-99:

10-05-99:

09-05-99:

- Added Omega Fighter dsw settings. Also, set the defaults, so they are the factory
  recommended settings (as detailed on the dsw info).
- Examine Run & Gun 2. It's a basketball game I think (big shame)... The hardware
  is interesting though, except I customized the 68020 core so much for f3-system,
  and this makes it hard to debug any other 68020 hardware... hmm, what should I do?
  Maybe add a debug-020 core for it, dunno.

08-05-99:

- Examine Puzznic set2. All roms are 100% identical to the first set. Also, the
  MCU is not dumped right (all bytes are either 00 or FE). Good news I guess :).
- Listen to Rotor amiga music, it's quite nice. I have the game, but didn't play
  it much...
- Addition of Omega Fighter. The arcade screenshot looked so nice :).

07-05-99:

- Put some config things in a raine_cfg struct.
- Added Joystick button editing and load/save... but it's not tested.
- Fixed Joystick edit bug (from mario's test in irc).

06-05-99:

- Temporarily replaced new sasound.c with old one. There are some problems with
  the new one where it uses memcpy() to copy sample data, it often trashes memory
  on my pc beacause the data overwrites the end of the dest buffer.
  All the other new sound files are up to date anyway, just need to fix the buffer
  looping memcpy() bits in the new 'sasound.c'...
- Scanlines are now black in Rainbow Islands. Any more games with discoloured
  scanlines? (it's a feature of the fast colour mapping mode that some games use).

05-05-99:

- New sound system is still not stable :(.
- Add Hiroshi other changes (YM3012_xxx macro, Darius priority change etc).

04-05-99:

- Improved Object and Road in Chase HQ and Night Striker.
- Added hardware triple buffer, but my gfx card does not support it, so I had
  to comment it out for now, because I cannot test it.
- Rearranged eeprom load/save. Datafile is no longer accessed in the drivers.
- (: Add Hiroshi new sound system!! :).
- Sound is causing crashes for me, even with 100% of hiroshi files...

03-05-99:

- Added Top Speed. The code roms are modified, but I expect the game will be
  almost identical to Full Throttle :).
- Added leds to Top Speed, Full Throttle and Continental Circus.
- Continental Circus has a dsw setting that allows the 3d glasses type effect
  to be disabled, phew :).
- Cleaned Chase HQ 2 and Continental Circus a bit and added Road Scrolling chip.

02-05-99:

- Tried Mutant Night on Mame, speed was terrible (autoframeskip 11), it also had
  the sprites sticking to screen bug!! The bug which made us decide to not include
  in raine0.20... lol :).
- Fixed Cheat engine for Z80 games. Tested with TNZS, Raimais, Fighting Hawk.

01-05-99:

- Impossible Joystick positions are now prevented. So, you can press up or down,
  but you cannot press up and down simultaneously, etc... Fixes some bugs, like
  on Ninja Warriors, pressing left, right and up all together caused bad stuff
  to happen to the main player.
- Removed about 5 custom joystick position fixes from the drivers, since it is
  now automatically checked.
- Added Joystick editingin gui, but you cannot edit them yet.
- Space baron my keyboard is breaking!It's so annoying...

30-04-99:

- Default keys are saved in raine.cfg [Controls].
- In games.cfg, use_custom_keys setting is saved for each game. Custom keys saved
  in games.cfg (only when use_custom_keys==1).
- Made some changes to add_input() to make raine.exe a bit smaller.
- Added tc0220ioc to Darius 2 and Ninja Warriors (coin led emulation).

29-04-99:

- Renamed Top Speed to Full Throttle for now.
- Fixed wrong joystick for player 2 in space gun, op wolf 3, silent dragon,
  op thunder.
- Started to add default key settings. However I am not sure the best way to do
  it:

  1 - one set of default keys, which apply to all games. this is a problem for
      keyboard, as the default keys for a 2 button game are prefably different
      in a 6 button game. annoys me.
  2 - different set of defaults for 1, 2, 4, 6 button games. this is annoying,
      as it makes changing the defaults more complicated and confusing if you
      don't pay attention. might get a lot of emails having problems with it.

  For an example of what I mean, look at the default mame keys for a 6 button
  game. A game would be hard to play on those keys, I think.

- The best fitting keys I can think of are:

     G[4] H[5] J[6] K[8]
    V[1] B[2] N[3] M[7]
  [      Space Bar      ]

  This will fit ok for most games I suppose. The reason 4-5-6 are g-h-j is
  because fighting games expect to have buttons 1-3 in one row (punches) and 
  buttons 4-6 in another row (kicks). Most games have 2 or 3 buttons.
- Added default keys and a default keys editor. Changed all game drivers.

28-04-99:

- Today, Jess (one of our cats) died, due to old age. I will miss her :(((.
- Added a guessed up road layer in Chase HQ/Night Striker.
- Fixed Dinorex bg colours (interrupt timing).
- Fixed Dinorex crashes/freezes (maybe). Caused by bad programming in the rom,
  leaving trash in some bits of the address registers.

27-04-99:

- Fixed Colour bug in Chase HQ.
- aracorn ChaseHQ set seems to have incomplete/bad sample roms.
- malcor ChaseHQ set has japanese sample roms (aracorn set is english).
- Added ChaseHQ Japanese (malcor set, renamed to ChaseHQJ).
- aracorn chasehq set: b52-m38.rom is bad. This was causing a lot of bad
  sprites in the game. Place b52-38 from malcor's set into aracorn's,
  and rename it to: b52-m38.fix. Delete the old b52-m38.rom if you like.
- Converted ChaseHQ to tc0220ioc. Coin LEDs are mapped.
- Fixed ChaseHQ a bit.
- Fixed Night Striker a bit too.

26-04-99:

25-04-99:

- Seta games look really lame, gfx look really low quality...
- Need to add extra opcodes to Neil's 6502 emu for 65c02:(. 
- Caliber 50 is a bad dump. Bad 68k code roms (odd bytes FF), missing 65c02 rom etc...
- Thunder Cade is a bad dump. Missing 80% of the 68k code roms.
- Seta games are crappy, wasting my time with these...
- Made Action Replay cheat names max 256 chars.
- Added file selector option when setting zip/rom dirs.

24-04-99:

- Added some game info, with some company logos.
- Added button#3 in Violence Fight.
- Emulation of Seta games requires a 6502/65c02 emulator to be added, and also
  I need a 6502 disasm.
- Ouch, 6502 code is ugliest mess to read. Reminds me of snes roms. 
- Need a better 6502 disasm than Marat's (need one with 6510 opcodes).
- I hope make6502 has less bugs than makez80 :).
- Added multiple M6502/6510 support. Does it work? Nobody knows...

23-04-99:

- I'm bored, really bored! :(.
- Added some dsw from Thomas Pitt...
- Got a new fan from madmax1, and fitted it to the p2-233 and fitted it to the mb.
  Just need the case :).

22-04-99:

- Fix Under Fire a bit. This is the most demanding Taito hardware I have roms for,
  it's like F3 System + F2 System + Z System, all in one! ;).

21-04-99:

- Split newgui.c into rgui.c and rguiproc.c.
- Started adding multiple window support in the gui, then got bored and realised
  it's not very useful anyway :).
- Tried Kiki Kai Kai and it has sound. I wonder what happened, since I seemed to
  fix itself (probably a Mz80 I/O ports bug I found the other day).

20-04-99:

- Fixed Tetris2+ Colour mapping.
- Added Sprite zooming in Taito Cup Final, International Cup 94, Cleopatra's Fortune.

19-04-99:

- Fixed Load Game when the game list selection is empty and you click load game.
- Fixed Snow Bros 2 missing sound.

18-04-99: Release

- Fixed a crashing bug with new loadgame on games with 1 68k and/or 1 z80.
- Made M6295 decode with a higher volume, this makes it louder in all games,
  possibly some games could have too loud samples now, most seemed acceptable
  for now (hopefully).
- Fixed Space Invaders DX (pixel clear, bg2 colours, added bg1 layer, changed
  screen size to 320x224 == b-system default, default language switch set to
  american). Looks much better now.
- Fixed Cybattler Priorities on level 4 and some other places.
- Fixed ARPro on 2x68000 games, like Cybattler.

17-04-99:

- Fixed Kaiser Knuckle and Arabain Magic Scroll Offset.
- Added the mouse pointer with a rainbow under it, I added it for when a game is
  loading (ie. the equivalent of the 'busy' hour glass in Win9x). Looks nice.
- Made updates to Raine.txt, I think I did enough of that, but I still have to write
  about my pc/hd/ppl who sent stuff...
- Made the vsync Automatic option work in raine config and added to gui. This option
  will use vsync only on games which need it (games which use direct mapper).
- Made vsync automatic even better, direct mapped games will only vsync when a
  colour change is found (eg. Arkanoid 2 will vsync during screen fades only).
- Fixed Twin Qix Illegal Interrupt.

16-04-99:

- Converted DD3 screen draw from x86 asm to C. C is easier to manage, and the
  colour mapping is better now. Also, fixed X high bit, used for stuff like TIME.
- Converted WF screen draw from x86 asm to C. C is easier to manage, and the
  colour mapping is better now.
- Fixed Cybattler level 4 and over gfx (second sprite bank wasn't rotated).

15-04-99:

- Tried to fix Mustang (not playable).
- Tried to Fix Insector X collision disappearing.

14-04-99:

- Fixed Zero Zone music looping, and also fixed the colour interference with the
  ingame messages in this game.
- Tried P47J in Mame, hmmmmm, autoframeskip goes to 11 (max?) and then the game is
  still only running at 50% speed... it's basically impossible to play it on a p120
  then =). lol.
- Changed P47J and EDF FG0 layer size.
- Increased MS-1 palette to 15-bit instead of 12-bit.
- Fixed a bug in using 2x68000.
- Added Mustang.

13-04-99:

- Still no luck with the cd-r's :(.
- Fixed Sprite offset in Puzzle Bobble 2 and 3. It is likely to be the same in
  Arkanoid Returns, so I fixed that too (but I cannot test, roms not on my hd
  and cd-r not available)...
- Made 'Loading Game' window look like all the other windows.
- Fixed Load/Save for if/when save data areas have changed size or been removed.
- Added Sprite-BG1 priority in Armed Formation, from calb.
- Added Zooming Sprites to Kaiser Knuckle and Arabian Magic.
- Got some roms from the cd-r's using my brothers pc and xfer to 1.44mb disks...
  But in return I have to let his friend borrow the n64/cps-2 roms cd... Argh, I
  wonder if I'll ever get that cd back :).
- Arkanoid Returns is ok now.
- Fixed About window saying MSDOS when it should say Windows 98.
- Made the gui scrollbars look nicer.

12-04-99:

- Argh, cd-r's are not getting recognized today atall :(.
- Rad Action is Ninja Kid 2, also Rad Action has some corrupt gfx roms.
- Added Ninja Kid 2 and Rad Action, currently using Robokid sound rom.
- Added Mutant Night.
- Improved Save/load, so it has less hacks for the cpu saving.

11-04-99:

- Renamed Robo Kid to Atomic Robo Kid.

10-04-99:

- Fix some bugs in new savegame format.
- Map some Atomic Robokid BG0-2 gfx roms, it seems there is not much order in the
  rom names in this dump, so I have to get them correct with trial and error :(.
- Got 2 cd's from mario =). Raine, mame, neogeo!!  Thanks :).

09-04-99:

- Added a better savegame format. Loading of the old format is fully supported.
- Got 2 cd's from razoola :). N64, CPS-2 and some consoles!

08-04-99:

- Inside Atomic Robokid roms:

  "MY NAME IS TOSHIO ARAI."
  "I AM A PROGRAMER OF THIS GAME."
  "I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU."
  "ADDRESS:"
  "TAGUCHI BLDG. 3F"
  "3-16-3,UENO,TAITOU-KU,"
  "TOKYO,JAPAN 110"

- Added Atomic Robokid.

07-04-99:

- Merged Sprite code for Dead Connection and Football Champ/Euro Champ 92.
- Dodgy BG layer zooming in Football Champ.

06-04-99:

- Readd Hiroshi adpcm sources, cannot test on many games yet.
- Changed Operation Wolf to hiroshi MSM5205, but something is wrong... Changed
  to slower colour mapping to fix scanline colours. slower, but everyone says raine
  is fast enough anyway.
- Fixed memory leak and mulitple chip support bugs in msm5205.c.
- Fixed? Football Champ sprite banking (doubt it's the correct solution).
- Added Sprite Zooming to Football Champ.
- Added FG0 scrolling to Football Champ.

05-04-99:

- Mario, retry Raimais big monsters, it seems fine here (you must start a new
  game, don't load an old one from an old beta).
- Readd Puzznic.
- Readd Sound Pause/Unpause in savegame and loadgame.
- Refixed up Puzznic and hacked mcu. If you select the 'Animation 20' rom version,
  you uncover pictures of nice Japanese girls when you complete a level! :).
- Added Popnpop.
- Fixed Puchi Carat sprite problem, possibly this breaks arkanoid returns, or the
  Puzzle Bobble games, but I can't check them yet.

04-04-99:

- Redid some gui fixes, redid 'press a key' window.
- Oops, I need DZ80 again.
- Added Game count information to game select window (tells you how many games
  are full/available/missing).
- Mario, you sent me the wrong/incomplete roms for kuri kinton.

03-04-99:

02-04-99:

01-04-99:

31-03-99:

30-03-99:

29-03-99:

28-03-99:

27-03-99:

- Lost too many files, and win95 bacame unusable... Reinstalled win95...
- Reinstalled some programs...
- Crashed HD (corrupt some more files).
- Some roms are lost (kaiser knuckle, puchi carat etc).
- Reinstall internet explorer, get virus scanners, find no viruses! :((.
- Crashed HD (corrupt some more files).
- Reinstall other essential things (winzip etc).
- Reinstall parts of djgpp.
- Compile raine.

26-03-99:

- Improved saving on L-System games.
- My hard drive is constantly messing up!! Many files are corrupting when I use
  it :(. I think, unless it is a virus, my hard drive is dying, which means I
  have no way to work on raine... I can't afford a new hard drive or a new pc :(.
- Changed a bit release games (we have some spare games).
- Hard drive crashed again! What happens is this:

1) Working fine
2) Hard drive starts making the normal sound it makes when reading/writing
3) Hard drive continues to make the sounds, but the hd led on my pc box has
   gone out!
4) It just continues making the sound of accessing data... no matter what I do.
5) I try ctrl-alt-delete or win95 restart computer, but even after resetting,
   the sound continues. Also, everything I try to run crashes, and win95 cannot
   reload (crashes).
6) I turn the power off...
7) Now when I turn the power back on, it works again... But when I check my hd
   for errors, I find a lot of files have been corrupted.
8) After a while, the problem occurs again and another load of files are lost!!
   SHIT!!!

- Unable to compile raine without crashes (file corruption in djgpp I expect).
- Maybe if I hit my pc hard enough, it will work again... =).
- It's getting worse, windows is messed up badly now. Many roms etc... are dead.

25-03-99:

24-03-99:

- Messed with the allegro-based gui code... Added support for movable windows,
  you will see a title bar on the windows, and you can drag the windows around
  like zsnes/callus :). This code is really slow, it's just a hack, but it seems
  faster already than bgui (bgui is used in snes9x dos, many crashes on my pc!).
- Removed the Raine logo from the background... But kept the back part... I am
  stuck as where to place the new raine logo! It's too big, maybe we can have
  some smaller, less colourful versions rendered???

23-03-99:

- Fixed a sprite chain problem in WWF Superstars, some guy pointed it out to
  me in irc.
- Put some sound in Toki.
- Added Kuri Kinton (it's not a custom cpu like the readme says, it's another
  L-System game).
- Examine Dark Mist. This looks nothing like Taito, and vixen listed it as
  Seibu, however there is a (c) Taito message in the roms. The custom cpu is a
  protected z80, but it looks very simple... The gfx roms look like garbage
  (protected or corrput). Most likely it is made by Seibu, licensed to Taito.
  Possibly Raiden hardware.

22-03-99:

- Wrote a set palette replacement that skips unmodified colours. This gives
  a nice speed increase, for my pc 5% more cpu time available :).
- Fixed Sprite-BG1 priorities in Fighting Hawk.
- Changed a bit hardware ym3812 emulation.
- Took out ym2203.c and ishm2203.oa, since it is currently not in use.
- Change the way sound is paused in pause mode.
- Added sound pause for hardware ym3812 emulation (thx cgfm for adlib info).

21-03-99:

- Added Volfied dipswitches.
- Used rdtsc to profile set_palette_range(). It's really slow! Takes 5% of
  the cpu time each frame!! PC's are so lame!!!... Now I have to work on
  trying to avoid calling set_palette_range() when possible. It's worth it
  for the extra speed.

20-03-99:

- Added trackball to American Horseshoes, but it needs changing. It's very
  hard to play properly with keyboard or mouse.

19-03-99:

- Fixed most of American Horseshoes gfx, also changed to vixen romset, since it is named
  better :).

18-03-99:

- Changed 16x16 mapped tile drawing to be very slightly faster (hard to notice any change).
- Made Puzzle Bobble 2 colours a bit better, also found and fixed some problems with colour
  mapping, which should improve the other games which use a lot of colours onscreen.
- Fixed Space Invaders 95 bases (sprites on level 1).

17-03-99:

- Changed YM2203/2610 fm part to be a bit faster.
- Re-add YM2151 Jarek version. I did this to try to fix Rastan 'noisy bits', but they are
  still there. Maybe it was correct to have the 'noisy bits'...
- Changed streams code (re-add from mame35b2 and seperate to streams.c/h).
- Fixed some things in Kiki Kai Kai.
- Fixed memory leak in sound (streams_sh_stop was not always called).
- Fixed streams.c trying to free() unallocated memory. This is a bug of mame code I think,
  on the latest versions of djgpp, bad use of free() can crash the pc.

16-03-99:

- Fixed Fighting Hawk speed (was running half speed).
- Added Colours to Kiki Kai Kai.

15-03-99:

- Added Fighting Hawk.

14-03-99:

- Fixed a bug that made rainbow islands occasionally crash.

13-03-99:

- Doubled 68020 cycles for some F3-System games (Puzzle Bobble series). This
  makes them play better. Puzzle Bobble 2 no longer gets stuck in the attract mode
  and the controls are always responsive now :).
- Tried to fix Insector-X collision... It used to work fine (more MZ80 bugs?).

12-03-99:

- Started adding Kiki Kai Kai, since it has an MCU, don't expect to see it reach
  completion. Also, I need a diff romset to the one I have.

11-03-99:

- Moved rotation stuff to a file (tc0005rot: don't have the correct chip name!).
- Camel Try and Don Doko Don colour mapper changed for vsync compatability.
- Now f2system.c only contains port colour ram routines, so I renamed it to
  tc110pcr.c (this is possibly the correct chip name).
- Added delete button in action replay gui.
- Fixed some bugs in MZ80 (I expect there will be more).
- Fixed some more MZ80 bugs... Certain MZ80 functions trash registers without
  push/pop'ing them (mz80int and mz80nmi for example).
- Fixed Snow Bros sound/Cabal Sound
- Fixed Cabal coin input.

10-03-99:

- Fix Battle Shark bg layers (add flip y code to tc0100scn).
- Changed Spce Gun and Operation Thunderbolt to use tc0100scn/flip y code.

09-03-99:

- Added some zooming to H/AIR-System (not quite correct).
- Prevented F3-System games from being able to write to rom (not that they were,
  but in a 68020 crash it might happen).
- Changed Terra Cresta colour mapping..

08-03-99:

- dejap.dat no longer needs to be appended to raine.exe, this is useful since
  it compiles faster now. However, I must try to remember to append dejap.dat
  for beta/release versions...
- Existing Raine screenshots will no longer be overwritten each time you reload
  Raine.
- Merge some H-System code. Since I do not know the tc chip names for H-System,
  I had to make one up (tc0004vcu)...
- Added LEDs to some H-System games, increased port range for tc0220ioc with
  Syvalion.
- Fixed Sprite Chain sizes in H-System (eg. Japanese text in Syvalion).
- Fixed Syvalion missing dragon's nose. It was caused by dodgy code in the rom
  (leaving garbage in top byte of a0-a7).
- Fix some Dynamite League and Record Breaker stuff.
- Change Air Inferno and Top Landing to tc0004vcu.
- Fixed small colour mapping problem after changing screenmodes.

07-03-99:

- Added Space Invaders 95. Nice game.
- Play lots of great amiga and sid music :).
- Added FG0 pixel scrolling to Galmedes.

06-03-99:

- Added Super Space Invaders 91 alt version (extra version maybe?).
- Fixed sprite offset in SSI/MJ12. This was due to Drift Out code merging.
- I guess the best name for SSI alt is Majestic Twelve, since the default
  rom setting is this :).

05-03-99:

- Fix Arkanoid Returns sprites on hiscores.
- Fix Drift Out sprites. Add FG0 layer, only used one time (test hatch).
- Made Drift Out have nice colours w/out vsync.
- Status of Bomb Jack Twin roms (hardware is similar to Bio Ship Paladin):

  --------+----------------------+-----
  BJT.100 | OBJECT tiles         | BAD
  BJT.127 | Sample data (M6295)  | OK
  BJT.130 | Sample data (M6295)  | OK
  BJT.32  | BG0-BG1 tiles        | BAD
  BJT.35  | BG2 (FG0) tiles      | OK
  BJT.76  | 68000 (odd)          | OK
  BJT.77  | 68000 (even)         | OK
  bjt.nfo | Comments of Metalman | OK
  --------+----------------------+-----

04-03-99:

- Added sprite zooming to Puzzle Bobble series.
- Fixed (hopefully) Hit the Ice freezing up.
- Added Hit the Ice controls for 2 players.
- Some more F3-System games have sprite zooming.
- Removed Final Blow sprite glitch.
- Made Twin Qix BG3 disable (green bg problem gone?).

03-03-99:

- Added zooming sprites to Twin Qix and Darius Gaiden.
- Added zooming sprites to Ring Rage.
- Started tc003vcu.c, this is supposed to be F3-System, but I don't know the
  correct tc chip name(s)...
- Added sprite zooming to Elevator Action 2.
- Fixed gfx roms in Kyukyoku Tiger 2. It seems the 1MB roms are all supposed
  to be just 512kb (E15-01/03/07/09.bin). It still takes ages to load on my
  16mb machine, which is why I didn't work on it for some weeks... Also added
  sprite zooming to Kyukyoku Tiger 2.
- Fix sprites and add zooming to Grid Seeker.

02-03-99: 'Zooooooom'

- B-System zooming completed, Rambo 3 is very nice, also stuff like Master of
  Weapons and Ashura Blaster.
- Add Zooming on Metal Black (it has zooming bg layers too, so don't expect
  everything to zoom yet).
- Added zooming on several other games (Gun Frontier, Liquid Kids, Don Doko Don
  etc...).
- Fixed sprites not getting disabled on Don Doko Don when you complete a level.
- Changed SSI to slower colour mapping (so it looks nice w/out vsync). Maybe I
  should change all games to the 'slower' code now?
- Added zooming sprites to Pulirula.
- Added zooming sprites to Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories :).

01-03-99:

- Added Sprite zooming in tc0180vcu. Not finished coding it yet, but it makes
  Rambo 3 look cool.
- Garmedes is renamed to Galmedes.
- Removed a load of pointless inline settings from game drivers (DrawGame() and
  ExecuteGameFrame() cannot be inlined by the compiler).
- Fixed SSI sprite glitch (finally). Added partial zooming support (eg. Ship in
  tunnel when you start game, butterfly wings).
- Added partial zooming to some other F2-System games, but I didn't test to see
  if it works yet.

28-02-99:

- Start merging tc0180vcu emulation, so far Rastan 2, Silent Dragon, Space DX.
- Added LEDs to Rastan 2.
- Changed all other B-System games to use tc0180vcu.
- Fixed a bug when expanding directory names to full path.
- Fixed a bug with showing the wrong avail/missing games, it was caused since we
  had more than 128 games in raine ;). Now it will work no matter how many games.

27-02-99:

- mz80 sucks...
- Added fixed Garmedes rom, works great first time. Mario: delete gm-m30.bin
  and keep new rom named gm-m30.fix. Also I think the correct name might be
  'Galmedes', check the title screen.

26-02-99:

- Spent forever trying to make fucking shit mz80 work anghhghghghghnhgnhg....

25-02-99:

- Time flies...
- Reduced Tatsujin 2 memory requirements (gfx roms should only be 1MB, second
  half is a repeat...).
- Add Fix eight (not playable, also sound part is protected (z80)).
- Change to Allegro 3.11 (joystick bug fixes, and a new joystick supported:
  Wingman Warrior).

24-02-99:

- Added Bio Ship Paladin. Playable, no sound, not sure about one of the bg layers.
- Drive Out == Drift Out bootleg
- Blomby Car == ?? bootleg ?? (driving)
- Magix == ?? bootleg ?? (puzzle)

20-02-99:

- Added good Ashura Blaster 68k roms. Easy.
- Rotated Ashura Blaster screen.
- Added Garmedes, easy, but one rom is partially corrupt :(.

19-02-99:

18-02-99:

- Improved the 'mapped' colour mappers so they look (always) correct without vsync.
  Most emus do this, which is a good thing (vsync is slow). For an example, try
  blood bros without vsync on raine 0.18 and now on the new raine... Or try F3-system
  games or many other games...
  eg. On Blood Bros, the screen fades don't look so nice with raine 0.18 + no vsync,
      but now they don't flicker anymore, so vsync can be turned off!

17-02-99:

- Changed some things in Top Speed (still not very good).
- Changed Rastan to use Hiroshi's MSM5205 emulator. Reduced volume of YM2151 in
  Taito games.
- Tried to change Operation Wolf to MSM5205, but there is a problem, because the
  code does not support more than 1xMSM5205... I will ask Hiroshi (if I see him).
- Added Saint Dragon dsw.

16-02-99:

- Changed Rainbow Islands and Rastan from single asm code to the generic asm
  stuff. I expected them to get slow but they actually got a few frames faster!! :).
  rainasm.S and rastasm.S are now removed...
- Changed Jumping Islands to generic taito asm, jumpasm.S is now removed too...
- Added Top Speed/Full Throttle (not playable). The roms are complete, it's just
  there is a lot of garbage code left in them. Usually, space is filled with 0xFF,
  but Taito have been sloppy this time!! :).

15-02-99:

- Added Legend of Makaj dipswitches from Udirnel. Also added end of game spell
  in cheats.txt. Nice game.
- Changed sample.c and also removed some now unused stuff. I mainly did this to
  work out what the code is doing! :).

14-02-99:

- Problem: Ashura Blaster and Battle Shark are both given the same board
  number (C43) !!... I'm sure one of these games is a different number !!
- Removed dategen.c and compdate.h. I found the correct method for getting
  a datestamp: use special compiler __DATE__ and __TIME__ defines.
- Ported IRA from Amiga to pc. I think I will release it on the weekend :).
- I didn't hear from Hiroshi for several weeks... I'm worried :(

13-02-99:

- Examine new roms:
  Wise Guy - Bootleg of Jaleco's Psycho Pigs UXB/Bombs Away(?)
  R-Shark  - Bootleg of ???
  Last Day - Bootleg of ???
  Jal Myst - Jaleco's Alien Command (might be Earth Defence Force 2, I see
             an EDF logo in the roms...)

- Fix Z80 roms (mz80 changes):
  Pipi Bibi/Whoopee - fixed
  Zero Zone         - fixed
  Operation Wolf    - untested
  Jumping Islands   - untested
  Chack n Pop       - fixed
  Tecmo Games       - untested
  Taito Games       - fixed
  Cabal             - untested
  Darius            - untested
  L-System Games    - fixed
  TNZS-System Games - fixed
  Nichibutsu Games  - fixed
  Technos Games     - fixed
  Volfied           - untested
  Legend of Makaj   - fixed
  Snow Bros         - silent [some bugs in mz80 as usual I hate mz80!]

- Remake ym3812.c and 3812intf.c, frequency is now supported for hardware
  emulation.
- Fixed Zero Zone crash.
- Made Energy Cheat for Legend of Makaj.
- Added movement in Arkanoid 2 (no mouse yet).

12-02-99:

- Changed starscream a bit (3-4% faster). starhelp.c is changed too.
- Speed up tc0100scn (start asm version).
- Add Growl and Dinorex dipswitches.

11-02-99:

- Converted about more 10 games to use tc220ioc (now they have leds).
- Fixed a Taito z80 nmi bug in ym2151 games. WantNMI and NMIEnabled *must* be init
  to 0, so I added tc0140syt_reset().
- Added tc0140syt_reset() to darius.c (since it uses z80 NMI too).
- Fixed Silent Dragon a bit (add YM2610, sprites).
- Added UseLEDS option to raine.cfg.
- Change liquid Kids to fix(?) missing sounds.

10-02-99:

- Started some generic tc0200obj emulation, this chip changes in many games, so it
  it hard to make one routine for all games... (without making it very slow)...
- Fixed layer offsets in Gun Frontier and added scrolling for FG0 layer.
- Added keyboard leds again and changed the way they are updated, so it is faster.
- Added coin leds to F3-System games (only tested bubble symphony, but they should
  all work; something for beta testers to test... heh).
- Made some generic tc0220ioc (input output controller) emulation. This includes
  leds for each game I convert (so far: Camel Try, Liquid Kids, Don Doko Don and
  Taito Tetris) See, these chip numbers are useful, must collect them all :).

09-02-99:

- Speed up apply_volume_16(), apply_volume_8(): Volume does not need adjusting
  when it is 255.
- Made Tatsujin 2 sprites a bit more in sync with scrolling (not 100%).

08-02-99:

- Fixed Cybattler and 64th Street missing sound (oops).

07-02-99:

- Removed debug numbers from Mega Blast screen (oops).
- Fixed background gfx in Rodland extra levels.
- Started Cheats.txt: List of Cheats and secrets in Raine games.
- Added good TNZS original romset.

06-02-99:

- Changed some things in lsystem.c, champion wrestler is playable (gfx not perfect
  and not optimized).
- Removed coff2exe line from makefile.

05-02-99:

- Fixed some MZ80 problems, changed bank switching in tc140syc.c.
- Hmm... Raine seems to have fast TNZS emulation now :).

04-02-99:

- MZ80 fixed, so TNZS now works with *fast* bankswitching (no more memcpy!).

03-02-99:

- Added Insector X, TNZS, Arkanoid 2.
- TNZS spends over 50% of the time just bankswitching (I think I have to make some
  changes to MZ80...).

02-02-99:

- Changed Operation Wolf to use tc100scn.c.
- Make tc002obj.c, old-taito object layer chip (Operation Wolf, Cadash, Bonze Adventure
  etc...). This is not the correct chip name, I just made it up until I have it.
- Add rotated 270 degrees code to tc002obj.c. Changed Earth Joker, Maze of Flott.
- Changed Asuka & Asuka.
- Added Action Replay search (some bugs) and made some new cheats.

01-02-99:

- Added fixed Don Doko Don rom.
- Added rotated 180 degrees code to tc100scn.c.
- Change Don Doko Don and Liquid Kids to use tc100scn.c (rotated 180 degrees).
- Fixed up Knuckle Bash a bit (sound not playing yet).
- Added rdtsc timer (sys16), more accurate timing, no more dropping to 59fps :).

31-01-99:

- Last minute fixes:
- Replaced Darius dipswitches (they were missing from Hiroshi source)
- Change toaplan YM2151 frequency to 3.5 MHz (Jim H told me last night).
- Readd safety checks in psgintf.c (they got removed by accident when I included
  Hiroshi source).
- I got the YM2151 timers to work correctly in snow bros 2 and truxton 2 now!!
  They sound a *LOT* better now =).
- Add option to disable rdtsc usage in raine.cfg (since not all x86 clones support
  it).
- Cleaned up the timing stuff and fps code.
- Mario: Please release the new version I send... (just need to add the new .exe).
- Play on Shark... [Rally Bike *is* supported, but I just got a blank screen and
  a sfx when I insert coins. New Zealand Story also *is* supported, although I don't
  have the right romset].

30-01-99:

- Added default epproms in dejap.dat (puchi carat, pb2x, bubble symphony).
- Move language files to config/language/ dir.
- Roms should load now, when not running from the raine dir (eg. raine\raine.exe).
  Removed case 7 from faq (loading from directory...), also changed some lines...
- Fixed up Raine.cfg.
- Fixed up new user messages.

29-01-99:

- Repaired Rodland English gfx roms, remind me to send the working set!
- Rodland Japanese will try to load samples (rl_10.rom rl_08.rom, from either rodland
  or rodlande archive).
- Added all Mame cheat codes (JCK from The Ultimate Patchers sent me them, plus a
  mame-raine cheat converter!).
- Fix command line for joystick/screenmode.
- Fix up raine.txt...
- ...more fixing raine.txt (seems to take forever!).

28-01-99:

- Small speed increase to MS1 Layer drawing.
- Replace YM2151 timer in ym2151.c (it was removed for mame, but I found it still
  alive in system-16 sources).
- Fix some things in mario bug list.
- Remove some aracorn games: Metal Black, Hit the Ice.
- Make a list of aracorn games, the unannounced ones are:

  Earth Joker		= Release 2/3 weeks later: 'aracorn pack#2: vertical shootemup games'
  Gun Frontier		= Release 2/3 weeks later: 'aracorn pack#2: vertical shootemup games'
  Gun Lock		= Release 2/3 weeks later: 'aracorn pack#2: vertical shootemup games'
  Kaiser Knuckle	= Release 1/2 weeks later: 'aracorn pack#1: fighting games'
  Legend of Makaj	= Relese now: It's small and will bring the gamecount to 85
  Rodland English	= Release now: Rodland Japanese is using the sample roms
  Violence Fight	= Release 1/2 weeks later: 'aracorn pack#1: fighting games'

- Ok, so we can make 2 releases new with the aracorn games, and there are plenty of
  aracorn games to finish emulating (metal black, hit the ice, z80 games, z-system games,
  f3-system games...).
- I'm annoyed to have to remove these games just a few days before releasing them, esp.
  Kaiser Knuckle, which has been ready for so long :(. "They *must* be released soon!!$^%˙˙"
- Did some html changes when checking announced games and moved the advert banner to the
  top of the page (it seemed in the way) :).

27-01-99:

- Added Eagle 0.41.
- Added MZ80 2.6, and Plotting is broken.
- Replace old MZ80 2.4, Plotting works again.
- Re-fix Pipi Bibi sprites.

26-01-99:

- Add Sample Rate and YM3812 switch in gui (sound setup).
- Modified sample.c/h, so sample rate can be modified ingame (all sound emulators must
  be removed and restated to accept the new sample rate).
- Removed saGetSoundCard(), and a similar part in saInitSoundCard(), because it is never
  used.
- Fixed Pipi Bibi bootleg sprite bug.
- Added Safty checks to: YM2203,YM2610,YM2151 in fm.c. This is a big bug with no soundcard.
  YMxxxxRead/Write() are called when YMxxxxInit() has not set up (many crashes in pure dos).
- Added Hiroshi changes (Darius 2 and Ninja Warriors screen fix).
- Moved safety checks to psgintf/3812intf/2610intf/2151intf... (so fm.c does not need to be
  modified).
- Rename CPU_FRAME_KHz to CPU_FRAME_MHz Doh! :).
- Fixed Tecmo sound, it was just a typing error stopping it working! (F8FF instead of F7FF).
- Why does the YM2203 emulation seem so slow?...

25-01-99:

- Fixed Interrupt Vectors in Taito L-System. Fixes Plotting test mode, improves Raimais
  colour fades. Champion Wrestler and American Horseshoes run a bit better too.
- Added Scrolling to Taito L-System (BG0/BG1).
- Increase VRAM access range (C000-FDFF).
- Fixed American Horseshoes colours.

24-01-99:

- Added Rodland English. Some gfx roms are corrupt, so I will fix them using Rodland
  Japanese... Changed a bit MS1SetSoundCPU().
- Added Final Blow good sample roms.
- Change some Cabal, Astyanax dipswitches.
- Hacha Mecha Fighter looks like the is some kind of protection.

23-01-99:

- Fix priorities in vertical toaplan 2 games (it was a typing error).
- Increase MC68000 speed to 20MHz in toaplan 2 games.
- Added (hopefully all) Hiroshi changes up to 17-Jan-98. replaced F2 Port Colour RAM
  with Hiroshi version (more compact) :). I will check layer offsets in Growl soon...
  Note the new files for tc0100scn and tc0140syt emulation, many game drivers have
  changed now to use tc100scn.c... Thanks! :).

22-01-99:

- Add M6295 bankswitch for toaplan 2 (only needed for Snow Bros 2, Knuckle Bash
  has only 1 bank, Truxton 2 has 2 banks, but second bank is all empty).
- Changed Dipswitch code to support more than 2 dipswitches (current max is 3, for
  toaplan 2 games).
- Compile release test version (remove HACKS, HACKS_SOUND, BGAMES).

21-01-99:

- Merged Snow Bros 2, Tatsujin 2, Pipi Bibi and Whoopee into toaplan2.c/h.
- Fixed up stuff on toaplan2 games. This file is getting as large as megasys1.c...
- Started to add Knuckle Bash.
- More toaplan2 fixes.

20-01-99:

- Mario needs to resend pgoal_22.rom :(.
- Mario needs to resend kbash06.bin :(.
- Added Tatsujin 2...

19-01-99:

- Changed some more games to tc100scn.c, improved tc100scn.c.

18-01-99:

- Place taito sound comm code in tc140syt.c/h.
- Start to place screen layer code in tc100scn.c/h.
- Add multiple tc0100scn chip support for F1-System (Thunder Fox). Priorities are wrong.
- Added some other games to use tc100scn.c. Some games should be better now (eg. game
  end in Cadash).

17-01-99:

- Added Earth Joker. Hardware is by Taito, game is by Visco. Please look for more Visco
  games! :). The Amuse emulator already plays music from Earth Joker and Garmedes, so
  I am looking for Garmedes roms...
- Merged Maze of Flott with Earth Joker.
- Added P47USA, uses some roms from P47J folder/ziprom.
- Work on Grid Seeker, sprite roms are strange, but they seem ok.
- Work on Kyukyoku Tiger 2. The 1MB gfx roms might be corrupt (second 512kb), the 2MB ones
  seem fine.

16-01-99:

- Add new ym3812 source from Carl. Add ym3812 sample loading (roms/ym3812, ziproms/ym3812.zip
  etc... just like another game romset).
- Ugh! Is it my modem or...? I cannot connect at all, error: no dial tone... but the telephone
  is working normally, so where is the problem... :(.
- Add J-Rom information to Taito Chip List.
- Disassemble some roms ready to emulate (Earth Joker, Grid Seeker, Kyukyoku Tiger 2, P47 USA).

15-01-99:

- Added Shingen fixed rom.
- Increase Shingen music speed (8 ints/frame to 24 ints/frame).
  Jaleco music speeds are done by YM2151 timerA, but timers don't work yet... :(.
- Added third button to Shingen (buttons are attack left, attack right, jump).
- Test more games...
- Fix Warrior Blade colour ram port access.
- Fix Darius2, Ninja Warriors colour ram port access.
- Add more stuff to translation file.

14-01-99:

- Add addgames.c from Hiroshi, I renamed it to games.c and placed it in source/games/
  What is the error with Japanese Win98/DOS? Djgpp error??...
- Remade gamelist, remove AddGame() calls.
- Add Company ID to gamelist.
- Add sorting to gamelist.
- Add new Hiroshi sources (M6295, Jaleco sound etc...).
- Add Jim H. Jaleco sound fixes.
- Repair Final Blow sprite colour mapping.
- Fixed Operation Wolf bootleg crash, also changed screen size to 320x240.
- Fixed Chack'n Pop crash. Game is protected, so I'm not looking at it now.
- Add option to dump gamelist.txt (raine -gamelist).
- Did some testing, see release.txt.

13-01-99:

- Fix sprite colours in Battle Shark.
- Get Hiroshi source.
- Add Whoopee (not playable yet). J-Rom's dump is an original, dump.it's version is a
  bootleg (Ryoutou Kikaku is a bootleg company).

12-01-99:

- Compile Allegro 3.1 release version. No changes in raine code.
- Added Snow Bros 2, the video hardware is actually quite similar to Pipi Bibi! :).

11-01-99:

10-01-99:

- Added Ashura Blaster, everything is working, except the broken rom is causing problems!! :(.
- Added Maze Of Elott.
- Fix up gfx in Maze of Elott, change to correct name: Maze of Flott.
- Worked out stuff about Volfied C-Chip. It is used for colour operations, and holds 90%
  of the sprite colours... :(.

09-01-99:

- Ashura has a bad rom, ashura31.bin should be 128kb, the info.txt even says it should
  be 128kb, so how come it is only dumped 64kb long?!?!??? Doh.
- Added American Horseshoes, merged L-System code. See lsystem.c/h for Raimais, American
  Horseshoes and Plotting.
- Added Champion Wrestler to L-System. Have some gfx (tile banking) problems, same as
  American Horseshoes (this is why I *hate* Z80 and 8-bit hardware!)... :).

08-01-99:

- Changed back to old Starscream (cadash works again... hmm...).
- Fixed Cadash, changed to new Starscream again, but with some old code i made (I'm not
  sure what the exact problem is, just that writelong is not 100% working in starscream
  0.25, I've wasted too much time on this bug for now).
- Add 32 byte buffer to Technos Sound Comm.

07-01-99:

- Added layer disable for camel try rotation layer.
- Added coin leds to camel try, but it seems set_led() is really slow... So I
  removed it for now. The keyboard controller wastes too much time responding. PC's suck!!
- Added YM2610 for Space Gun.
- Changed some more colour mappers.

06-01-99:

- Add Hiroshi code (old: fm.c; new: megasys1.c sound etc...).

  speed up camel try drawing.

05-01-99:

04-01-99:

- Add rtdsc profiling code (press F11 some times). Probably crashes mario's pc! :).
- Add faster code for ingame 6x8 text (was allegro textout).
- Removed ssiasm.s (since it was only clearing screen).

03-01-99:

- Added rom banking support in m6295.c/h, removed okiadpcm.c/h.
- Please note changes in m6295 and m6295 interface (has 2 rom bank entries). Is this
  ok?
- Added Tecmo sound (currently silence, hmm...).
- Did some asm for Zoop (meka emulator).

02-01-99:

- Added Seal 1.06 (release version?).
- Fixed Snow Bros missing sound with software ym3812.
- Very strange bug, I can't seem to leave the castle in Cadash anymore!?!!!? :(.

01-01-99:

  raine.cfg).

31-12-98:

30-12-98:

29-12-98:

- Added Raimais.
- Fixed 64th Street sprites (it was a typing error). Also fixed 64th Street samples.
- Add Cheat code for Camel Try (I need it!) :).
- Start Tetris 2 Plus (MegaSystem-32? 68000 or 68020?).
- Made some scrolling macros.

28-12-98:

- Added new z80 sound rom to Thunder Fox.
- Added Don Doko Don, this game uses a zooming and rotating layer, like Camel Try and
  Drift Out. Needs some work. Also, one gfx rom is *corrupt* all odd bytes are 00 in
  b95-03.bin :(.
- Fixed a bug in Screenshot saving (oops, Mario wont be able to make screenshots).
- Fixed rotation colours in Don Doko Don.
- Fixed rotation colours in Camel Try.

27-12-98:

- Added most Hiroshi changes. Volume+Panning changes, Darius2+NinjaW sprite fix etc...
  Did not have time to change fm.c or other files yet (sorry).
- Changed Joysticks to new Allegro id's (they were probably broken in the last beta).

26-12-98:

- Fixed some gfx on Camel Try. Playable now, use mouse or keyboard (I prefer keyboard).
- Changed some games that have to clear screen each frame (ssi, camel try, superman etc).

25-12-98:

24-12-98:

- Added Battle Shark.
- Fixed some gfx on Dead Connection.
- Fixed some gfx on Metal Black, Gun Frontier.

23-12-98:

- Change sprite order in Asytanax.
- Another small change to colour mapping code.

22-12-98:

- Small change to colour mapping code.

21-12-98:

20-12-98:

- Changed to Allegro 3.1 alpha.
- Remade Screen Selector and Config File for new Allegro display mode id's. Now
  use MODX/VB30/VBAF etc... instead of 0,1,2,3 etc...

19-12-98:

- Added Astyanax, there seems something strange with the M6295 roms, maybe the
  hardware can swap the M6295 roms around?
- Added Puzzle Bobble 4 new romset. BG priorities are not right ingame.
- Changed MS1 Sprite Chain cache a bit.
- Ugh! My Battle Shark archive is corrupt... Mario needs to resend: BShark04.rom.

18-12-98:

- Arghh!! My birthday sucks!! :(
- Changed Zero Zone to Hiroshi's M6295 emulator. Not sure about M6295 frequency.
- Added M6295 to Taito YM2203. Also not sure about frequency, ask Hiroshi...

17-12-98:

- Add all new sources from Hiroshi: sound changes, streaming oki/m6295 emulator, many
  sound improvements (see: changes-hiro-shi.txt)!
- Added pcmrom loading to all games in megasys1.c. Not all tested yet.
- Added romsize to m6295 interface, and different rom decode routine, some roms
  like kick off had problems decoding samples...
- Moved sample.c/h to sound dir.
- Cleaned some gfx code in MS1.
- Reset PCMROM to NULL in default.c (PCMROM is freed with resetmemorypool() in
  default.c, so not needed in every cleargame(). Ok?
- Updated raine.cfg template, added darius sound settings, sorry for delay.
- Merged MS1 sound68000 memory map add.

16-12-98:

- Keeps crashing all the time (ziproms keep failing, keeps crashing on exit).
  DJDev202 and Allegro problems, it seems:

  * calling free() with NULL, or already free memory is not safe in new djgpp.
  * using push/pop_config_state() in allegro is not completely safe.

- Ziproms still fail...

- Added new internal Zip support using the zLib extension MiniZip:
  http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html
  This is NOT ripped from mame ;).

- Fixed Cup Final freeze.
- Added music for Violence Fight and moved to generic routine in taitosnd.c
  (B System YM2203=Hit the Ice, Master of Weapons, Violence Fight).
- Added bank switch for B System YM2203.
- Converted Jumping Islands sound to software YM2203 (sound better and support
  both ym2203's). Currently, Ishmair's ym2203.oa is not in use, but I didn't
  remove it yet.

15-12-98:

- Started translation files support with new allegro routines.

14-12-98:

10-12-98:

- Fixed BG0-BG1 Priority (Phantasm/Avenging Spirit).
- Doubled Cybattler music speed (correct?).
- Changed some palette mappers to generic, single filed Ninja Gaiden and Tecmo Knight.

09-12-98:

- Fixed up Bubble Bobble Symphony gfx and stuff.
- Fixed Bubble Memories to run at correct speed (it was too slow).

08-12-98:

- Added Legend of Makaj, with sound (Z80, YM2203). Hardware is a primitive MS-1.
- Fixed up Cybattler and 64th Street gfx a bit. Added Sound.

07-12-98:

- Jaleco improvements:
  Fixed Gfx rom mapping on Kick Off sprites and P47 BG0/1 layers (big ship appears).
  Added BG0 colour bank swap. For Earth Defence Force and bits of Phantasm. Not 100%.
  Added Sprite:BG1 Priority, for many games. Saint Dragon (dragon goes behind trees),
  EDF (sprites 'flicker' behind clouds), P47 (bullets go behind hills).

06-12-98:

- Fixed Sprite Banking in Growl and Ninja Kids. Info from Brad Oliver.
- Added Bubble Bobble Symphony!! (Taito F3-System).
- Added Earth Defence Force (Jaleco MS1-Hybrid).
- Added Shingen (Jaleco Protected MS1, Saint Dragon protection).
- Examined Top Speed, looks like a 3 screens chase hq style game, 2x68000 with
  z80 ym2151 adpcm. Unfortunately, the main 68k roms are dumped too small...
  B14-23 and B14-24 should both be 128kb :(.

05-12-98:

- ym2203 sounds different in Plotting with new sound system. Is this correct?!
  Hiro-shi: Is new ym2203 more accurate than old one?
- Tried to slow down Plus Alpha. Now some parts are too slow... :(.

04-12-98:

- Added Hiro-Shi game changes: Darius, Darius 2, Rainbow Islands, Warrior Blade...
  Test new sound system, Mega Blast sound dropped from 71fps->62fps... Hmm...
- Replaced ym2151.c with faster version (sounds the same anyway).
- Changed all YM2610 games to set sample rom sizes and buffers. Moved setym2610buffers()
  out of fm.c and into taitosnd.c.
- Changed rom size safety checks in ym2610 (now fm.c). Do the checks before playing
  adpcm, for speed.

03-12-98:

- Changed all BG0 Solid tile buffers to single routines MakeSolidTileMap8x8(),
  MakeSolidTileMap16x16() (less code, smaller exe).
- Added Hiro-Shi new sound system :).

02-12-98:

- Changed more games to generic palette code.
- Made some minor changes to Chase HQ and similar hardware.

01-12-98:

- Xmas is coming!

30-11-98:

29-11-98:

- Moved gfx related files to a seperate dir (video).
- Fixed some F3 System eeprom hacks. Kaiser Knuckle rom version switch to Gloabl
  Champion.
- Moved pre-compiled object files to seperate dir (compiled). Also changed file
  names: xxx.o -> xxx.oa (Hiro-Shi).
- Changed most F3-System games to be more generic. Made generic routine for solid
  tile checking, as nearly all games use this code.

28-11-98:

- Some Jaleco changes.

27-11-98:

- Finished fixing Gun Lock, added romswtiches (different title screen: Ray Force).

26-11-98:

- Tales of Phantasia.
- Put some colour mappers in palette.c, instead of having them in the game files.
- Started to change raine.txt for another release...
- Added Sound only frame for some games, this allows music to continue playing when
  a game is paused! :).

25-11-98:

- Changed 68020 code a bit, no speed change?

24-11-98:

- Made Rainbow Islands Extra have some correct sprites. Unfortunately the c-chip
  data is not all the same as Jumping Islands/Rainbow Original.

23-11-98:

- Finished Comba Tribes. It seems to be missing an end sequence (because it's
  a bootleg?).
- Cut Comba Tribes roms to correct sizes.

22-11-98:

- Added corrupt puzzle bobble 4 sprite roms. It's playable, but it looks messy.
  Also there are 1 (or 2) pb4 roms totally undumped! :(.
- Fixed bug causing Rainbow Islands to crash. A typing error, made by me :(
  sorry...
- Started gfx emulation for Comba Tribes.
- Added more Darius dipswitches (from mutewitness).

21-11-98:

20-11-98:

19-11-98:

18-11-98:

- Mario RPG on zsnes beta =)...
- Some more optimizations to YM2610. (Mega Blast sound test, song $0C:
  62fps -> 71fps).

17-11-98:

- Fixed up Pipi Bibi/Whoopee and added Z80+YM3812. Every 4 levels, you get
  to see a 'naked' girl! But press F7 to disable sprites and you find they
  seem to be missing their pussies (not drawn in)!! hehe :).

16-11-98:

- Added support for oki rom banking (Double Dragon 3, WrestleFest).
- Added support for multiple oki chips (MegaSystem-1, will need it).
- Removed Atomic Point, it's Sega hardware (System 16 emu).

15-11-98:

- Added Puchi Carat, works very well.
- Fixed up most of Gun Lock.
- Compiled in new Allegro and Seal betas. Changed SNESPad support, beacuse
  it's now provided in Allegro :).
- Doubled music speed in Terra Force and Armed Formation, Jim Hernandez said
  it should be twice what it was in 0.16a.

14-11-98:

- Added Cabal roll buttons.
- Fixed up most of Gun Front, quite a cool game.
- All the Jaleco roms are 100% deprotected now, btw :).

13-11-98:

- Fixed YM2203 missing channels (Problem with SetVolume[] and SetPanning[]
  being uninitialised...).
- Fixed some things in Plotting (more fg0 gfx, hack for palette, speed hack).
- Pulirula fixed itself somehow :).
- Moved all saUpdateSound(60). saUpdateSound(60) is called now for every game
  after executegameframe().
- Corrected P47j BG1 tiles.

12-11-98:

- Added all Hiro-shi code, some problems:
 . Pulirula has some wrong adpcm (fixed by recompiling)
 . YM2203 missing channels (Plotting, Hit the Ice etc...) (fixed)

11-11-98:

- Started the remaining Jaleco games: Cybattler, 64th Street (MegaSystem-2?).
- Started Jaleco Samples (Saint Dragon). Rodland might be missing sample roms?
- Added Pulirula and Warrior Blade sample fixes from Hiro-shi :). Will try to add
  all Hiro-shi code tomorrow...

10-11-98:

- Improved Jaleco emulation, most games are playable and look good.

09-11-98:

- Added Starscream 0.25.
- Added part-deprotected Plus Alpha and Hachoo.
- Added Avenging Spirit... It's the English version of Phantasm!

08-11-98:

- Found FG0 gfx in Plotting and added a gfx cache for them.
- Began decoding Hachoo and Plus Alpha... Also improved Phantasm a bit
  (no crashes, but not yet playable).
- Added some Darius DSW settings.
- Added some extra lines to the stretched 256x240 code for safety.
- Examined CPS-2 SF2A, it has encrypted 68k opcodes and immediate data,
  but other data is unprotected... Looks like more than bitswapping though.
- Added 12 new vesa modes: 640x100/120/150/160/200/240 800x150/200/300
  1024x192/256/384. Some useful modes for 2/3 Screen games! :). Thanks to
  Dark Force.

07-11-98:

- Added Richard Mitton's excellent Plotting driver :).
- Changed Plotting to software YM2203 engine.

06-11-98:

- Added some Jaleco games:
  Saint Dragon (playable; not fully deprotected yet)
  Phantasm (not playable; not fully deprotected yet)
  P47J (playable, some bg gfx wrong)
  Kick Off (nearly playable)

- Rodland sound comm fixed, proper music speeds and sound effects.

05-11-98:

- Damn!! There is some more protection on the Jaleco roms (some parts switch to a
  different bitpattern, so I have to work out this other combination and also how
  it decides where to use the different pattern. Also, there could be many more
  combinations, this is getting very nasty!) :(...
- 100% deprotected the other bitpattern in Saint Dragon and Phantasm. Worked out
  how it switches between patterns (I think). It looks 100%, I really hope it is.
- Arghh!!! It's got more patterns, another 2, and quite possibly another 4 on top
  of that :(. They are also a lot harder to work out, because of the position in the
  rom :(.

04-11-98:

- Progress in Tales of Phantasia again...
- 100% deprotected 2 of the Jaleco roms (Saint Dragon and Phantasm)!! Yeah!! I'm
  so cool :) hehe. There are 2,004,189,184 possible combinations for the protection
  in these games, maybe I should look at those cps-2 games :).

03-11-98:

- Compiled with new Allegro beta. No major changes, but joysticks should be fixed
  (eg. zsknight's gamepad problem).
- Changed Double Dragon 3, Wrestle Fest, WWF Super Stars sound emulation. Added
  YM2151, Z80 and more accurate samples. Also for Comba Tribes.
- Wrote quick OKI ADPCM emulator. An easy chip to emulate.
- Started Comba Tribes, I guess it was 'Technos Tuesday' today :).

02-11-98:

- Changed the way Zero Zone samples are emulated. OKI ADPCM.

01-11-98:

- Rotated Gun Front, but it still needs more fixing.
- Added Puzzle bobble 4, seems to be working fully, except the missing gfx and
  sound roms... sigh...

31-10-98:

30-10-98:

- YM2610 about is 8 fps faster (Mega Blast sound test, song $0C: 54fps -> 62fps).

29-10-98:

- Ripped the Fullscreen 256x240 mode from FWNES98.exe :).

28-10-98:

- Fixed up Asuka.
- Optimized YM2151 code. Also took out the multiple YM2151 support, because we
  have no dual YM2151 games. Test on Rainbow Islands showed increase of 8 fps
  (78fps -> 86fps).

27-10-98:

- Fixed up Gun Lock (not completely). Rotated the screen.
- Added Rambo 3; playable with sound, but need to add sprite zooming.
- Looked at Under Fire, it's not F3-System compatible, different gfx hw.
- Added Asuka & Asuka; playable with sound, but need to tidy it and add samples.

26-10-98:

25-10-98:

24-10-98:

- Fixed Puzzle Bobble 2, oops!
- Fixed SnowBros/Winter Bobble sound (hopefully for good).
- Added sample support to Nichibutsu games (Armed Formation, Terra Cresta, Terra Force).
- Made some .txt changes/config file changes for the release.
- Looked at Jaleco roms (Mega-System and others), and half of them have protection! :(.

23-10-98:

- Changed Bonze Adventure/Jigoku to YM2610. J-Rom's readme said it was YM2203, but
  it's actually YM2610...
- Added Banking in Hit the Ice Z80, done via the YM2203, like the weird YM2151 ones.
- Fixed missing cars on Crime City Level 2.
- Fixed Rodland Scrolling (really annonying, but obvious).
- Fixed lots of things not worth mentioning.

22-10-98:

- Finished the 68020 optimizations (for now) and fixed some bugs. Better test every
  game, so far I've tried:
  Bubble Memories, Puzzle Bobble 2, Puzzle Bobble 3, Cleopatra's Fortune, Arkanoid
  Returns.
- Merged Taito YM2151 into generic routines (like the YM2610 routines), also added
  the weird bank switching (very weird, it goes via $1B on the YM2151, I wonder how
  Hiro-Shi found it...). I changed it slightly to Hiro-Shi's version, as I don't like
  to add it in the YM2151 source, or it will get hard to implement new versions of
  the YM2151 files (ym2151.c/fm.c), so I put it in taitosnd.c.

21-10-98:

- Tried Puzzle Bobble 2, the semi-asm 68020 core really is an improvement! :)
- Added improvements to the DSW dialog: shows the dipswitch bits, an idea that I
  got from tnzs-final :). Also, an option to reset the dipswitches to the 'factory
  settings'.
- Added MZ80 2.4, nothing seems better or worse at the moment (Liquid Kids still
  crashes).

20-10-98:

- Some hacking on the Ensoniq OTIS and 68000 rom...
- Joystick in gui (untestable by me)...
- Gun Front, Gun Lock, Under Fire and Riding Fight added (probably not playable yet).

19-10-98:

- Lots of hacking with the UAE68020 core, it's much faster now and in asm. Can never
  be as good as writing an asm core from scratch (or based on Starscream), but it's
  quite a lot faster than it was. Must make some speed tests to compare it, but I'm
  getting 90fps on arkanoid returns intro screen (on a p120, with vsync and limit speed
  off).

18-10-98:

- Added Arkanoid Returns (playable, but have to go to test mode to switch to joystick
  control first).
- Removed Prefetch buffer macro from 68020 core (waste of space, unused in our version).

17-10-98:

- Changed back part of YM2610 (adpcm channel 6).
- Fixed Missing Sprites in Kaiser Knuckle (dumb error, also found it in 5 other
  F3-system games).

16-10-98:

- Fixed Starscream bug/missing feature with 24-bit pc getting used as 32-bit, some
  games leave junk in the top byte (Fixes Pulirula).
- Tidied Thunder Fox a bit (need to find bg priorities and needs line-line scroll).
- Fixed Pulirula gfx (changed to the compressed palette code), removed masking sprite
  (title screen fix).

15-10-98:

- Renamed West Side to West Story.
- Fixed West Story Sprites (old gfx are ok, just the format is weird! oops).
- Added West Story Controls, Dipswitches (assume DSW are the same as Blood Bros).
- Fixed the Sound Clicking problem (increased number of sound buffers). It seems
  fixed, I really hope it is :).
- Started sound options in gui.

14-10-98:

- Added Dipswitch information to Terra Cresta and Terra Force.
- Added Layer disable on Armed Formation (BG0,BG1,SPR,FG0).
- Changed Armed Formation screen size (seemed too wide).
- Rewrote Command Line code and put it in a seperate file (config.c). Still
  lots of missing options.
- Added missing BG1 layer in Terra Force, layer disable (BG0,BG1,SPR,FG1) and
  Sprite-BG1 Priorities.
- Fixed Armed Formation BG0,BG1 colours and gfx.

13-10-98:

- Lots of progress in Tales of Pantasia on zsnes, I've been lazy and done no
  coding tonight!
- Added 512x386 resolution in Screen Selector.

12-10-98:

- Added YM2151 and samples in Cabal.
- Changed the memory handling in 'newmem.c', now it keeps track of all.
  memory resources allocated using 'AllocateMem' and frees them automatically,
  so there is no need to put 'FreeMem(ROM/RAM/GFX/SMP/PCMROM/etc)' in ClearGame()
  Should make the .exe smaller and the drivers are simpler...
- Added good version of Dynamite League gfx roms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
