# cycle:
#
# This is the quantum of time for preload.  Preload performs
# data gathering and predictions every cycle.  Use an even
# number.
#
# Note: Setting this parameter too low may reduce system performance
# and stability.
#
# unit: seconds
# default: 20
#
cycle = 20

# usecorrelation:
#
# Whether correlation coefficient should be used in the prediction
# algorithm.  There are arguments both for and against using it.
# Currently it's believed that using it results in more accurate
# prediction.  The option may be removed in the future.
#
# default: true
usecorrelation = true

# minsize:
#
# Minimum sum of the length of maps of the process for
# preload to consider tracking the application.
#
# Note: Setting this parameter too high will make preload less
# effective, while setting it too low will make it eat
# quadratically more resources, as it tracks more processes.
#
# unit: bytes
# default: 2000000
#
minsize = 2000000

#
# The following control how much memory preload is allowed to use
# for preloading in each cycle.  All values are percentages and are
# clamped to -100 to 100.
#
# The total memory preload uses for prefetching is then computed using
# the following formulae:
#
# 	max (0, TOTAL * memtotal + FREE * memfree) + CACHED * memcached
# where TOTAL, FREE, and CACHED are the respective values read at
# runtime from /proc/meminfo.
#

# memtotal: precentage of total memory
#
# unit: signed_integer_percent
# default: -10
#
memtotal = -10

# memfree: precentage of free memory
#
# unit: signed_integer_percent
# default: 50
#
memfree = 50

# memcached: precentage of cached memory
#
# unit: signed_integer_percent
# default: 0

# doscan:
#
# Whether preload should monitor running processes and update its
# model state.  Normally you do want that, that's all preload is
# about, but you may want to temporarily turn it off for various
# reasons like testing and only make predictions.  Note that if
# scanning is off, predictions are made based on whatever processes
# have been running when preload started and the list of running
# processes is not updated at all.
#
# default: true
doscan = true

# dopredict:
#
# Whether preload should make prediction and prefetch anything off
# the disk.  Quite like doscan, you normally want that, that's the
# other half of what preload is about, but you may want to temporarily
# turn it off, to only train the model for example.  Note that
# this allows you to turn scan/predict or or off on the fly, by
# modifying the config file and signalling the daemon.
#
# default: true
dopredict = true

# autosave:
#
# Preload will automatically save the state to disk every
# autosave period.  This is only relevant if doscan is set to true.
# Note that some janitory work on the model, like removing entries
# for files that no longer exist happen at state save time.  So,
# turning off autosave completely is not advised.
#
# unit: seconds
# default: 3600
#
autosave = 3600

# mapprefix:
#
# A list of path prefixes that controll which mapped file are to
# be considered by preload and which not.  The list items are
# separated by semicolons.  Matching will be stopped as soon as
# the first item is matched.  For each item, if item appears at
# the beginning of the path of the file, then a match occurs, and
# the file is accepted.  If on the other hand, the item has a
# exclamation mark as its first character, then the rest of the
# item is considered, and if a match happens, the file is rejected.
# For example a value of !/lib/modules;/ means that every file other
# than those in /lib/modules should be accepted.  In this case, the
# trailing item can be removed, since if no match occurs, the file is
# accepted.  It's advised to make sure /dev is rejected, since
# preload doesn't special-handle device files internally.
#
# Note that /lib matches all of /lib, /lib64, and even /libexec if
# there was one.  If one really meant /lib only, they should use
# /lib/ instead.
#
# default: (empty list, accept all)
mapprefix = /usr/;/lib;/var/cache/;!/

# exeprefix:
#
# The syntax for this is exactly the same as for mapprefix.  The only
# difference is that this is used to accept or reject binary exectuable
# files instead of maps.
#
# default: (empty list, accept all)
exeprefix = !/usr/sbin/;!/usr/local/sbin/;/usr/;!/

# maxprocs
#
# Maximum number of processes to use to do parallel readahead.  If
# equal to 0, no parallel processing is done and all readahead is
# done in-process.  Parallel readahead supposedly gives a better I/O
# performance as it allows the kernel to batch several I/O requests
# of nearby blocks.
#
# default: 30
processes = 30

# sortstrategy
#
# The I/O sorting strategy.  Ideally this should be automatically
# decided, but it's not currently.  One of:
#
#   0 -- SORT_NONE:	No I/O sorting.
#			Useful on Flash memory for example.
#   1 -- SORT_PATH:	Sort based on file path only.
#			Useful for network filesystems.
#   2 -- SORT_INODE:	Sort based on inode number.
#			Does less house-keeping I/O than the next option.
#   3 -- SORT_BLOCK:	Sort I/O based on disk block.  Most sophisticated.
#			And useful for most Linux filesystems.
#
# default: 3
sortstrategy = 3
