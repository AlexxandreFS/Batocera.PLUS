# Auto Fullscreen

This is a dumb 10 lines or less plugin to give FireFox Quantum the ability to launch in Full Screen mode. On startup it simply updates the current window to set the window state to fullscreen. For best results set a homepage and configure Firefox to launch with that homepage on startup. Please create any issues on Github or submit a pull request for fixes.
