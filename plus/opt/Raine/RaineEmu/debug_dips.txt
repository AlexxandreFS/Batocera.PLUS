General Information

     * What are Debug Dips?
       Debug dips are debug settings added into arcade games at the time of
       development by developers themselves to aid testing and de-bugging of
       the game. They might add features, re-introduce removed items, allow
       you to play boss characters, add new gameplay modes and hidden menus
       or just make you invicible...
     * Why don't I just use in-built cheats in the UniBios?
       Debug dips are already in the game and vary wildly from cheats that
       are already in the UniBios, for example certain codes might let you
       run the game in its original graphical and musical state (see Puzzle
       Bobble's 'Arkanoid Mode') or allow you access to whole hidden menus
       ingame (see Pleasure Goal), they are also hardcoded into the games
       themselves by the developers so are entirely different from normal
       UniBios cheats (hence Raz sticking a mode in to switch them on :P) in
       addition, ocassionally (it's rare but it happens...) there might
       actually be a game that lets you cheat ingame in a way not supported
       yet by the UniBios - for example see the King Of the Monsters 2
       invicibility cheat. Also it is worth noting that you might not HAVE a
       UniBios, you might be running one of the original Debug Bios chips,
       this wiki page should definately make you smile... :)

INFO: How Debug Dipswitch modes work...

   Generally you can enable debug dips at the title screen for desired
   effects to take place (unless noted otherwise in the dip settings above),
   however - some modes, for example - in game debug menu's might require you
   letting the game cycle once back to the NeoGeo boot up logo before the
   code has the required effect.

   On a multislot system if you have more than one game in this means
   allowing the MVS board to cycle thru all games back to the one you are
   running: to avoid this simply set those codes at the NeoGeo logo itself
   and make sure your game you are messing with is in SLOT1 :P

   For games that require console mode and a coin in to activate a menu (Like
   Metal Slug 2/X/3/4/5), try popping a coin into your coin chute whilst in
   console mode + make sure your UniBios is not configured for SELECT as coin
   in as this will stop you being able to pause and insert a coin
   seperately...

INFO: Debug Dipswitch Wiki Notes

     * Collected together by Ne7 + (add contributors name here) from various
       sources... I'll keep adding to this page as I find them, do add your
       own finds! :)
     * [Data in square brackets are credits of source for dipswitches if
       known]
     * See bonuskun's original dipswitch page here:
       http://www.neo-geo.com/snk/dipcodes/dipcodes.html

       here:
       http://www.randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/MetalSlug-MissingInAction/MSAction-debugmenu.htm
     * What does the phrase "Job Meter" mean?
       A job meter is a programmers way of ascertaining how long a particular
       routine is taking in terms of CPU time, this can be achieved by
       writing colorbars or shadow to the screen and reading how far down the
       screen the lines go to see how fast the routine is running... hope
       that clears that up, it's nothing to do with TV Modes this :) more in
       depth info here: http://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Job_meter
