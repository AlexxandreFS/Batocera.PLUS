1 What is Raine?

Raine is an emulator, it emulates some M68000 and M68020
arcade games and is mainly focused on Taito and Jaleco games
hardware. It started as an experiment with the Rainbow Islands
romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate many
nice games now, including new additions from Cave and other
companies. Sound was improved thanks to the work of Hiromitsu
Shioya. More recently, 

Several new programmers have joined Raine Team, adding drivers
& making improvements.

Emulating cpu's and sound chips takes quite a lot of coding
time, so, like most of the current emulators, Raine uses
emulation engines already available when possible. Raine
uses the following:


CPU:

M68000: Neill Corlett's Starscream 68000 emulator.

M68020: Based on Bernd Schmidt's UAE 68020 emulator.

Z80: Neil Bradley's MZ80 emulator.

M68705 Richard Mitton's static recompiler. 

SOUND:

YM2151: Jarek Burczynski.

YM2203 Tatsuyuki Satoh.

YM2610: Tatsuyuki Satoh and Hiromitsu Shioya.

YM3526: Carl-Henrik Skaarstedt.

YM3812: Carl-Henrik Skaarstedt.

YMZ280B: Aaron Giles (from MAME source)

ES5506: Aaron Giles (from MAME source)

M6295: Hiromitsu Shioya.

M6585: Richard Bush.

MSM5205: Hiromitsu Shioya.

2 Requirements

[These are rough estimates, based only on the DOS version
of raine, full speed means running at 60fps with no frameskipping]

Abundant requirements:

* Pentium II Processor with MMX (Minimum 300Mhz for Taito
  F3 Sound)

* 64Mb of ram (128Mb for Cave games)

* Win9x/Win2k/WinXP/MSDOS/Linux

* A sound card.

* Graphics card (VESA2 or better support recommended for
  dos)

=> You should get full speed in nearly all games with sound
at a high rate (my current pc).
=> You can vastly improve the emulation speed in the Taito
F3 games on slower computers by completely disabling sound!

Average requirements (MSDOS):

* Pentium Processor

* 16Mb of ram

* Win9x/MS-DOS

* 'DOS friendly' sound card

* Graphics card (VESA2 or better support recommended)

=> You should get good speed in most games with sound at
an average rate. Many games should be full speed (my old
pc). Note that some newly added large games will need more
RAM though.

Minimal requirements:

* 486 SX-25

* Win3.1/MS-DOS

* 12Mb of ram

* 'DOS friendly' sound card

* Graphics card (VESA2 or better support recommended)

=> You should find many games playable if you disable sound
and set a manual frameskip of about 4 (JCK's pc).

3 Specific versions

3.1 Introduction : which one is the fastest ???

I would say :

1. Dos version with VBE driver

2. Linux version with SVGA driver

3. Linux with DGA, and Windows with DirectX accelerated (fullscreen)

4. Windowed modes

Dos is still the fastest version because it has direct access
to the hardware, with no multi-tasking to slow it down.

SVGA comes 2 because it's almost the same kind of access
as VESA in dos...

The so-called accelerated drivers in windows and DGA in linux,
and last the windowed modes.

3.2 Building a mini-raine

Starting with version 0.32, you can build a CPS only raine.
Just type "make RAINECPS=1"
instead of "make" when you build
raine.

3.3 DOS

Nothing special to say here. Raine dos has always existed
! It is still probably the fastest version available, because
it has not the restrictions of the other versions which
are running in multi-tasking environements...

If you want to compile it, see [http://www.logiqx.com/HowTo/HowTo.shtml||Logiqx site].
It should be as easy as typing "make"
once you have installed everything needed !

3.4 Linux

3.4.1 General description

This version supports an incredible amount of video drivers.
Here they are :

* VGA : not very usefull, but since it's available...

* ModeX : (by direct access to the ports, you have to be
  root to use it). Note : the port access is safe, you can
  even switch from or to X while using raine in ModeX in
  the console !!! This mode is not very fast though.

* SVGALib, It gives faster results than modeX. You also need
  to be root to use it (well, starting with the 1.9 dev
  branch, certain video cards can be used by normal users
  in svga, but it is still very experimental...). Note also
  that SVGAlib can be dangerous, and you might finish with
  a black screen if you use it too much (then if you really
  can't get your screen back to normal, then Ctrl+Alt+Del
  should do : a nice reboot). More about SVGAlib : this
  is the fastest driver available for 8bpp games if a driver
  exists for your video card, especially if you use an agp
  card, and you can configure your agp port for full speed
  (SVGAlib does not do it yet, but X does...). 
  You can build your list of custom modes for svgalib. For
  that use the newmode command in the libvga.config file.
  The deduced syntax for newmode (since it is not documented
  !) is :
  newmode width height colours width*(bytes_per_pixel) bytes_per_pixel
  Yes I know, it can look redundant, but that's what the
  config file expect...

* Example :

# Here is a mode for a ZX Spectrum emulator:

Modeline "256x192@73" 12.588 256 269 312 360 192 208 212
240 doublescan

newmode 256 192 256 256 1

newmode 256 192 65536 512 2

Modeline "320x224" 12.75 320 340 388 400 224 228 230 240
doublescan

newmode 320 224 256 320 1

newmode 320 224 65536 640 2

Modeline "384x240" 20.00 384 392 440 480 240 244 246 262
doublescan

newmode 384 240 256 384 1

newmode 384 240 65536 768 2

Modeline "360x288" 20.00 360 368 416 448 288 292 298 310
doublescan

newmode 360 288 65536 720 2 # 8bpp does not work for me here...

Modeline "360x256" 18.00 360 368 416 448 256 260 266 278
doublescan

newmode 360 256 65536 720 2

* X, which allows raine to run in a little X Window. For
  this one, no prviledges are needed, any user can run it.
  Of course it is not very fast, but with a fast X server
  on a fast computer, everything runs fine ! And it can
  even be run remotely ! Then it is much slower, but it
  is fun !!!

* Xwindows fullscreen : New in 0.32a, this driver allows
  a normal user (not root) to have raine in fullscreen in
  X11. However DGA is faster, so use DGA if you can !

* X with DGA. You have to be root to use it. It looks like
  the directX modes of windows (full screen). Very nice,
  especially with the customized graphics mode (see below).
  Very fast too, especially in 16bpp or higher. New in 0.31
  : the list of available modes is built from your XF86Config
  file.

* Frame Buffer : if your kernel is configured to use frame
  buffer, then raine will use it in the console. You don't
  need to be root to use it, and it is very fast. I did
  not tried customized modes yet and the list of cards supporting
  it well is very little. Moreover, in 8bpp you are stuck
  with the slow palette functions from Allegro, which makes
  it slower than SVGA (normally). The list of modes is red
  directly from /etc/fb.modes.

3.4.2 Compiling sources

This version has the exact same requirements as the dos version.
You should be able to just type "make"
once you have installed everything needed. See [http://www.logiqx.com/HowTo/HowTo.shtml||Logiqx site]
for more details.

3.4.3 Going further

One of the nicest features of this new release is the addition
of a DGA2 driver. To access this driver, you must be root,
and run raine in a DGA-enabled XFree server. DGA is enabled
by default if your X server supports it.

In short, DGA is the equivalent of DirectDraw for linux.
But since it is based on XFree, it can access any graphical
mode that you can define in X, and that makes it VERY interesting
!!!

Enabling arcade video modes in your X server

This should enable you to enjoy full screen DGA for almost
any raine game. Especially now that raine knows how the
change the resolution (and the depth) for each game loaded.

If everything goes fine, you should find :

modelines : this is a file distributed with xmame generally,
and containing the definitions of these most usefull modes.

XF86Config-4.sample : my config file for my X server.

Basically, my XF86Config file shows you how I adapted this
file from mame to my configuration. You should especially
be carefull to have right values in your HorizSync and VertRefresh
(capabilities of your monitor). Note also that I was obliged
to remove all the modes with a width < 320 pixels and those
with a width = 400 pixels, since my configuration could
not support them. The next steps is to add the modes you
want in the Modes lines of your "Screen" section. Then you
should use xvidtune to center theses modes on screen, and
you are done.

International keyboards in XFree :

Just rename the allegro-fr.cfg included with raine to have
support for french keyboard in X11. For other keyboards,
see xkeymap in allegro... (sorry I know it's convinient,
but it's the way allegro works for now). Without it, some
keys won't work in X ! (3 key for french keyboards for example...).

3.5 Windows

3.5.1 General description

Graphics drivers : this version uses 3 full screen drivers
(Accelerated, safe and software), and one windowed driver.
The overlay driver is a hacked windowed driver based on
a fullscreen one to be even faster, but it works only on
very few video cards... All the video effects do not work
with the accelerated driver. Try them, and choose the one
you prefer, depending on your preferences... If you just
use standard video, with no special effects, then the accelerated
driver should do.

The windows version is heavily dependant on the version of
the graphics drivers you are using for your video card.
For example a few drivers render distorted palettes while
raine is making fade-ins or fade-outs, and the gui palette
is distorted sometimes in 8bpp. If you experiment this try
to update your graphics driver version and/or directx.

For sound, we left all the drivers available in allegro for
now, but the only driver really working is the AllegMix
driver. 2 settings for this one : Default, or specific to
a soundcard. Try them... Also we found lately that the AllegMix
drivers require your soundcard to support hardware acceleration
in directx. You can find out if yours does by running dxdiag.exe.
If your soundcard does not support this, you will just hear
silence !

3.5.2 Installing from sources

In recent versions of allegro (4.0.0) and gcc, raine can
now be either be linked staticaly or dynamicaly with allegro.
The default is now dynamic, like linux.
To compile raine using mingw32, just define MINGDIR in your
environement :

set mingdir=c:\mingw (for example)

Then go to the raine directory and type make.

For djgpp, djdir must be defined.

Linux, cygwin and Freebsd are using the OSTYPE environement
variable.

Nothing specific to say. You can build allegro from sources
or install the binary library plus the include files. Raine
can now be linked with the allegro dll built by MSVC.

For more detailed instructions on how to build raine (not
allegro), refer to [http://www.logiqx.com/HowTo/HowTo.shtml||Logiqx site].

4 Installing roms

Before playing any game, you need to find the correct romset.
Try the links at the end of this text or a search engine.
If you can't find them, too bad. When you have downloaded
some games you can either:


a) Put the zipped rom in the raine\roms\ directory

b) Unzip the roms to raine\roms\<gamename>\


* Note that you don't need to unzip your roms, it's just
  an option. See below.

* If you get stuck, learn about directories first (also read
  rainefaq.txt - err, well raine faq has been lost recently,
  but now we have a forum... !)

4.1 Zip Support

You also can place zipped copies of the romsets in the 'roms'
subdirectory (eg. raine\roms). Raine will then access the
zip to load the roms, saving a lot of diskspace. Zip support
is now internal to Raine (using zlib+minizip), this should
be faster than before.

4.2 Rom directories

You can now configure three different rom paths via the gui
or config file (very useful if you have some roms on CD).
Also, you can configure three different ziprom paths. To
do this, click on 'change game', then on 'dirs'. Either
type in the paths, or use the file selector (click the small
square buttons).

Options:

  -verbose    Show extra information for some options  



Other options are available only from the GUI/config file
for now.

For example, to load Wrestle Fest: raine -game wrestlef
If you get VESA errors, get Scitech Display Doctor from www.scitechsoft.com.
You can also use shorter command line options like -n (-nogui),
-g (-game), -sx (-screenx) etc...
See the gui for more screen resolutions from 80x80 to 1600x1200.

6 Performance tips

Usually raine is already very fast "out
of the box", but these tips might help you to
make it run even faster. If you want to be able to tune
performance settings, you must display the rdtsc timers
: press F11 3 times, and you should get a few % displays
on the top right corner of the screen : CPU, Sound, Video,
Pal, Misc, and Free.

6.1 Video

Games will usually run much faster in 8bpp than in any higher
color depth, except if the game really uses more than 256
colors. This is because if you choose 16bpp, then raine
must write 2 bytes for 1 pixel, and it writes only 1 byte/pixel
for 8bpp.

Games known to actually use more than 256 colors are Atlus
Cave games (Esprade, dodonpachi, Guwange...), and maybe
one or 2 others.

If you are in 8bpp and the game uses more than 256 colors,
then you will see the number in front of "Pal"
in the rdtsc display going high. Normally the palette number
should stay at 0 or 1% (or maybe a little higher on very
slow machines). In any case it should be constant. If you
see it raising, then you have a palette problem. First check
"fast_set_pal[fast_set_pal]",
and if fast_set_pal is ok and you still have the problem,
then switch to 16bpp.

Video effects should not slow down very much the game play
except the stretch functions which are still in software
mode.

6.2 Sound

In Sound Options, you can choose the sound bitrate. 22Khz
is the good average value. I don't know any game which actually
uses 44Khz, so the difference should not be possible to
hear. 11025 Hz is for the very slow machines : the quality
gets lower, but you still have sound, and the sound creation
is faster.

You can also choose "Silence",
to turn off sound, which should greatly improve speed, especially
in taito-f3 games.

6.3 The Free number

It shows how much free cpu power you have. If it is > 0,
then your game runs at 60fps.

If you see it jumping very quickly all the time, then it
most probably means that you are running another program
in the background which is eating your cpu power. Raine
is very sensitive to this in multitasking environements
because it synchronises with the rdtsc counter of the cpu
which will never slow down, no matter how loaded your cpu
is. A java applet in the browser can eat a lot of cpu power
for example !

6.4 Windows version

This version has not many things you can change for performance.
Just be sure to run in full screen, which is much faster
than in windowed modes, and prefer 8bpp color depth than
16bpp or more.

6.5 Dos version

Be sure to use a fast video driver : VESA 3.0 or VBE/AF.
To use these, you will very likely be obliged to use Scitech
display doctor. Grab it from our archives page if you don't
have it.

6.6 Linux

If you can be root on your machine, use DGA or svga modes,
and prefer 8bpp. If you can't, then well, the standard X11
modes should do. Frame buffer modes are quite fast too,
but it's very hard to have custom video modes in fbcon.

7 GUI Usage

Just type raine in DOS or in linux, or double-click raine.exe/raine32.exe
in Windows, and the gui should appear:

Play Game: Play the currently loaded game.

Change Game: Load a different game.

Control Setup: Change key settings/joystick type.

Screen Setup: Change screenmode/scanlines/vsync/frame
  skip etc...

Sound Setup: Change soundcard/sample rate.

Game Setup: Reset game/dipswitches/rom switches/cheat
  codes (see below).

About Raine\Game Info: Information
  about the loaded game.

Quit Raine: Back to Win9x/DOS.

7.1 <Snapshot>Snapshots

Starting with version 0.32a, raine can now display some little
snapshots of the games in the game selection dialog. For
that, you must download a snapshots pack from the raine
site, and unpack it in your raine directory. It will create
a snapshot directory, filled with pcx files.

For info, the snapshots are 130x76 for horizontal games,
and 70x120 for vertical games.

7.2 Screen Setup

This dialog requires some descriptions, but I'll avoid the
obvious and describe only the most obscure parts... 

7.2.1 General settings

Frame skip : normally should stay on "Automatic".
  It can allow you to have a fine tune if you are running
  raine on a very slow computer which drops frames all the
  time, and you want a constant frame rate anyway.

Triple Buffer : it's to try to improve display quality,
  but it deos not work with all video drivers and requires
  some more cpu power. With most modern monitors, you should
  be able to leave this off.

Limit Speed : except if you want to run some kind
  of benchmark, you should leave this on. If you turn it
  off, raine will try to run the game as fast as it can,
  making it totally unplayable most of the time !

Vsync Palette : This option is for despearate cases :
  when your colors flicker you can try to turn this on,
  but it might be slow. Some better things to try : in windows,
  upgrade your video driver. Try to run the game in 16bpp.
  In DGA 8bpp, if you use the default allegro library it
  will automatically synchronize the palette whatever is
  your setting. So the palette cpu time should be around
  10-20%. If you use the patched allegro version, or if
  you use a raine binary from an official distribution,
  then the palette WILL NOT be synchronized by default.
  It's usefull because most games don't change very much
  their palette during game play, so colors don't usually
  flicker at all. If they flicker too much for you anyway,
  then turn this setting on.
  You can also try the fast_set_pal setting in raine.cfg :
  
  fast_set_pal<fast_set_pal> = 1 is the default.
  In Windows if all your colors are bad in full screen with
  this setting (for 8bpp games) try fast_set_pal = 2. This
  setting will have no effect in windows 2000 and windows
  xp, because these OS forbid direct access to the palette.
  For the same reason it won't work in linux DGA or X11
  drivers, but it will work in linux svga and fbcon drivers
  ! In dos, it should work everywhere.

Auto mode change : When raine knows for sure
  which video modes are supported by your video hardware,
  it tries by default to choose the best mode for the game
  you are loading. It does not change the color depth though,
  so if you see the palette cpu time rising (F11 key by
  default), then it's time to switch to a higher color depth...
  There are rare cases though when you might want raine not
  to change the video mode. That's when you are running
  with a crapy monitor which does not like mode changes
  for example, or when you want to run the raine debuger
  (which requires a large screen of course). In these cases
  you can turn this "Off".
  The setting is automatically saved by raine.

7.2.2 Video Effects

Eagle : doubles the rendered picture size with some dithering
  effect to avoid square pixels. This effect only works
  in 8bpp, and does not work often in the accelerated win32
  driver.

Pixel double : Same as eagle but without the dithering
  effect. You will get square pixels but it will work in
  any color depth.

Double width<Double width> : can be useful
  with scanlines.

Stretch Max : Stretch the rendered bitmap so that
  it will take the largest area on screen while still keeping
  its aspect ratio. Warning : this option as well as "Stretch
  FS" is using software blits until now so they take
  some considerable cpu power !

Stretch FS : FS is for Fullscreen. Stretch the rendered
  bitmap to display it in the whole screen (no black border).
  Of course, you might loose aspect ratio here, and in this
  case your picture will look weird.

7.2.3 Scanlines

The scanlines don't work in any windowed mode (in linux and
win32). It's because they are rendered by a hack on allegro
bitmaps and this hack does not work in windows. Also they
usually don't work with the accelerated driver of the win32
version.

If you allow raine to select the best video mode when you
load a game, then it will keep your scanlines setting when
selecting its video mode.

Fullheight : Requires a mode with double height to be available.
  I mean if you want to have 320x240 with fullheight scanlines,
  then the 320x480 mode must be available with your current
  video drivers. In recent raine versions (0.34 and up),
  only the supported video modes will be listed when you
  select fullheight scanlines (with most video drivers).
  The result is just the mode yuo selected plus a nice scanline
  effect :) !

Halfheight : This one has no special requirement. It divides
  the current height of the screen by 2. That is if you
  are in 400x300 and then you select halfheight scanlines,
  you get a 400x150 mode with scanlines effect. Of course
  the aspect ratio is changed and that is where the double
  width[Double width] effect comes usefull !

7.3 Sound Setup

This dialog allows you to choose your current sound driver,
the frequency to use, and whether to max mixer or not (only
in allegro, not with the seal version - dos and win32 use
seal by default for the audio). Notice that if you choose
a high frequency then it will require more cpu time to be
rendered. The default of 22050Hz is probably the best for
most games (I don't know any game with samples higher than
22050 Hz, so 44100 Hz can make a difference only with FM
music).

In 0.35 you also have a new checkbox "Max
mixer volume". This checkbox not only makes
the mixer volume maximum, it also disable an allegro feature
which tries to remove any distorsion in sound by making
voice volumes lower. If your sound is really too quiet you
can try to check this box. It is very efficient at making
sound louder !

7.4 Game Setup Options

From the Game Setup menu, you can change some things related
to the games functions, but you need to know the consequences
before altering these options, so:

Reset Game:

Reset the game emulation, you'll lose your current game progress
unless you've saved it first.

Also, if you are using "Continuous
playing" from version 0.31, this really resets the
game, losing any saved data like hiscores...

Dipswitches:

This option allows you to alter the dip switch settings for
the current game. This feature is also present somewhere
on the arcade originals, but any changes you make are not
guaranteed to work until the game is reset, so you should
click on reset game after any changes. This is the nature
of Dipswitches.

Action Replay:

This is a cheat system, see 'Action Replay' Cheating[6 'Action Replay' Cheating]
below.

ROM Version:

This is Taito specific. With most of Taito's roms after 1987,
they use a byte of the rom to define which continent/language
the arcade board is for use in. Usually there are two main
variants:

* Japanese version: Usually with a 'this game is for use
  in Japan only' copyright message at the start. The game
  will not necessarily have Japanese text, sometimes it
  will (eg. Cadash, Liquid Kids).

* American version: Usually with a 'this game is for use
  in America only' copyright message at the start. Also
  the American version nearly always has a 'winners don't
  use drugs' logo (or sometimes 'recycle it, don't trash
  it' logo) at the start.

For some games there are more interesting/useful version
settings too:

This option is sometimes risky to switch between (it's not
possible for arcade owners to switch it at all, unless they
get a new set of 68k roms). You should always reset the
game after changing the setting. Also, with the F3-System
games, changing this setting will void the game's eeprom.
When this happens press the test mode key (default is 'u')
to reset your eeprom. You might also need to click on 'reset
game' again to achieve a clean reset with F3-System. 

Possibly we should force a reset when the rom version changes,
but for now it's your choice.

8 'Action Replay' Cheating<6 'Action Replay' Cheating>

There is a simple implementation of an Action Replay type
cheat system. Many console emulators have the option to
apply 'action replay/game genie' type cheat codes, although
they usually don't have a search option, which is a shame.
The cheat stuff in raine is split in two windows. One for
editing cheat data and one for searching for cheats.

8.1 Cheat Editing

In this window you can do the following:

* Enable/disable cheats

* Edit cheat data

* Delete cheats

* Add new cheats

If you get messages like 'work ram error' appearing, wait
for the title screen before enabling cheats. This is the
nature of Action Replay cheats.

8.2 Cheat Searching<Cheat Searching>

In this window you can find new cheat data. To start a search,
click new search, then choose a search mode. When you are
ready to continue the search, click continue search. There
are four search modes:

Absolute search:

* Searches for absolute byte values.

* Most useful for lives and other data.

Relative search:

* Searches for the difference between byte values.

* Useful when absolute search fails, like if the game stores
  lives starting with ascii 0x30 or stores lives +/- 1 from
  the value shown ingame. Remember that if the difference
  is positive you should enter something like 0x01 (+1),
  if it is negative, then you should be searching for 0xFF
  (-1).

Single Bit search:

* Searches for single bit values.

* Useful for status flags, and stuff like 'extend' in bubble
  symphony, which is stored in 6 bits of one byte.

Slow deep search:

* Searches for the following changes in byte values:
  new byte == old byte, new byte != old byte,
  new byte >  old byte, new byte >= old byte,
  new byte <  old byte, new byte <= old byte

* Useful for timers and anything not found with the other
  modes. A nice cheat to have is invulnerability, use this
  mode to find the invulnerability timer.

The search results are shown in a listbox, when there are
more than 512 results, only the first 512 will be in the
listbox. You can double click on the search results to open
a scrollable hex/ascii view of the memory area where the
result lies. Any bytes that are in the search results will
have *..* around them, so you can easily spot them.

10 Sound options

10.1 Mixer

Start the mixer by pressing "Tilde"
(this is the key just below escape on most keyboards) after
starting a game to display every audio stream allocated
by each sound chip of the current game. The game continues
while the mixer is on screen so you can still hear the sound
and you can now adjust the volume of each channel, either
with the mouse or with the keyboard (TAB and arrow keys).

Keep in mind that the game continues while adjusting volume,
but you can always reset the game or restart after eg. loosing
a life. The mixer can't work while the game is paused or
while the gui is displayed.
In linux at least (but probably with the other ports as well),
moving the sliders by keeping the mouse button pressed on
it makes the sound to loop. It is because of allegro - nothing
to do about it for now. So you should probably adjust the
sound with little clicks rather than big ones.
Press "~" again to return to the game or click on Exit.

10.2 Saving sound to a WAV file<Saving sound>

You can now save sound to a wave file from the sound options.
You can choose to have a graphical monitor of what is being
saved over the game screen.

This function is mixing the different sound channels to be
saved in software mode. As a result, the sound might not
be exactly like what you hear during gameplay. In some games,
it might also be saved too loud (in this game you can hear
distorsions). If it happens, just adjust sound volume with
the mixer before starting to save to a wav file.

The wav file is named raine_sound.wav and is saved in the
raine directory.

11 Hiscore support

The hiscore.dat file which should be in your raine directory
allows raine to save the hiscore of some games in the savedata
dir. The hiscore files have the name of the game, with extension
".hi".

Starting in 0.32, the hiscore.dat is fully compatible with
mame. It means you can safety use the last unofficial hiscore.dat
file for mame. 

12 Continuous playing<Continuous playing>

This option allows you to automatically save a game when
you quit, and automatically load it when you load the rom.
It allows to keep high scores for any game without the hiscore.dat
file, can be used as an emergency save function !

Enable it by running raine with the "-cont" option. Disable
it with the "-nocont" option. You can also edit the raine
configuration file. In this case, change "auto_save" option
in [General] options.

Of course, it eats lots of disk space, so it is off by default.

13 Demos

With Shift-F2 you can save a demo. With that you can save
everything you are doing in a game. To stop the saving,
just press P (for pause) or ESC to call the GUI. To read
a demo, press Shift-F4. 

14 General Controls

Here are the default controls for raine. 

14.1 General ingame keys:

0 Save screen shot (named raine???.pcx)

F2 Save game state

Ctrl-F2 Save game state by name

F3 Switch save state slot (10 different slots)

F4 Load game state

Ctrl-F4 Load game state by name

Shift-F2 Save demo

Shift-F4 Load demo

F11 Toggle the fps/profile display (5 different modes)

~ Display/Remove the sound mixer

PGUP Increase manual frame skip (no effect with auto frame
  skip)

PGDN Decrease manual frame skip (no effect with auto frame
  skip)

HOME Increase cpu execution (useful debug - slows motion
  and music)

END Reduce cpu execution (useful debug - slows motion and
  music)

ESC Return to GUI (exit to host os when the gui is disabled)

TAB Return to GUI (will active gui even if it is disabled)

P Pause the game

14.2 Keys in Pause mode:

DOWN Scroll display down (if the gamescreen does not fit)

LEFT Scroll display left (if the gamescreen does not fit)

RIGHT Scroll display right (if the gamescreen does not
  fit)

ESC Return to GUI (exit to host os when the gui is disabled)

TAB Return to GUI (will active gui even if it is disabled)

P Unpause the game

14.3 Default Player keys:

3 - Coin A

4 - Coin B

T - Tilt

Y - Service

1 - Player 1 Start

2 - Player 2 Start

UP - Player 1 Up

S - Player 2 Up

DOWN - Player 1 Down

X - Player 2 Down

LEFT - Player 1 Left

Z - Player 2 Left

RIGHT - Player 1 Right 

C - Player 2 Right

V..M - Player 1 Buttons 

Q..E - Player 2 Buttons

See the GUI to redefine these keys.

14.4 Misc:

CTRL+ALT+END Emergency exit to DOS (works at anytime, but
ugly). The default game buttons are not ctrl and alt, this
is due to the intrusion of windows keys between ctrl-alt
on many keyboards (lame).

Ctrl+Alt+Del does the same thing in windows at least.

14.5 Analog Controls in Chase HQ<Analog Controls in Chase HQ>

Raine now emulates the analog behaviour in the Chase H.Q.
controls. You can use a standard PC steering wheel and pedals
setup in analog mode. :)
The input behaviour is selectable in the dip switches menu,
there is also a new option to change how the gear works.

Important: If you are upgrading from a previous version of
RAINE, you MUST reset the dip switches to the new factory
defaults. Dip switch settings stored from older RAINE versions
will cause the game to malfunction. 

14.6 Gun controls in Spacegun

The following options are available in the game dipswitches
menu:

Mouse Speed Allows to change the mouse speed

Digital Input Speed Changes the speed
  of the crosshair when using the keyboard or a DIGITAL
  joystick/gamepad.

P1 Input Control Select what device you want
  to control the Player 1 gun, choose from mouse, analog
  joystick or digital (keyboard and gamepad).

Show Crosshair An option to hide the crosshair (not
  part of the original game, added for ). This option is
  usefull for taking faithfull screenshots or disabling
  the second player crosshair if you're only using one player.

14.7 Extra controls for the Taito F3-System games:

F5 Toggle BG0 Layer

F6 Toggle BG1 Layer

F7 Toggle BG2 Layer

F8 Toggle BG3 Layer

F9 Toggle Sprite Layer

F10 Toggle FG0 Layer

F12 Toggle Pixel Layer (if used)

There are occasions in F3-System games where things look
better if you disable a BG layer, for vaious reasons. Reasons
like bg zooms, 'snes-like' transparencies, misc line-line
effects including scrolling, priority swapping, enable-disable,
also zooming on a line-line basis. These things are not
emulated currently. F3-System is a full 32-bit system, and
it's no fun trying to add all that on a p120.

15 Config Files

raine.cfg (rainex.cfg for linux, and raine32.cfg for windows):
  Contains general raine settings and comments

games.cfg Contains input, dipswitch and rom version settings
  for each game

cheats.cfg Contains game cheat codes

raine.cfg and games.cfg are automatically generated, so they
are not supplied in raine.zip. raine.cfg is also automatically
commented, you should read it. cheats.cfg is also updated
when you make changed in within gui.

17.1 Special Thanks

Many thanks to the following kind people who have donated
hardware to help when my old HD died. Not only did I get
a new HD, but I actually got half the components of my pc
updated!! Certainly, there would not be any raine in the
last 4 months without them, because I could not afford to
buy a new HD.
NaMcO for sending 2x16mb simms and a 6GB HD when my old HD
gave up on me 
MadMax1, Nemesis1 & Sigurdur H. Olafsson for collectively
sending me a p2-233 and mainboard and also a non-ps/2 keyboard
adapter
Prophet of Retrogames for the Sidewinder Gamepad
Malcolm Laurie for the generous donation towards buying arcade
boards and an ATX case
Glenn Hagon for another 2x16mb simms
Mario Silva, Razoola & Pincushion Man for the cd's to help
restore what I lost

And many other people that helped us getting some donations
so we could buy boards like Strahl:

Harald, Till, Jason S., Kobayashi, Tormod, Estranged, Empyre,
Mario Lowang...hope I didn't forget anyone. ;)

If you would like to send a contribution to help with the
development of raine, maybe some old hardware or some money
or anything else, please email us. How does money help?
Well, It can go towards upgrading my pc, which allows me
to be more ambitious in what I try to emulate (for example
f3 system with more gfx features). Or, it will go on my
phone bills, which are caused by time online doing raine
related things. Or it can be used to buy new boards for
the rom dumpers. We can't offer much in return, but you
can of course beta test new games in the emulator.

17.2 Rom Dumps

The supported romsets were dumped by the following people,
many thanks:

18 History

18.1 Raine v0.36

New games :
Strikers 1945, Tengai (alias Sengoku Blade). Both are nice
shooters from Psikyo.
New clones :
Gunbird (replaces the old broken world set), Esprade (newer
international and japenese versions), Samurai Aces (international
version of Sengoku Ace)

* Added the ability to save sound to a wav file (in sound
  options[Saving sound])

* Added adpcm sound in toki and silkworm

* Fixed sprites priorities in the cps1 driver, and in double
  dragon 3.

* Made the psikyo driver a little faster

* Fixed the sound mixer

* Stephane HUMBERT fixed the dipswitches for Grand Cross
  Pinball

* Added the ability to edit registers and to manually generate
  irqs or nmis to the z80 debuger included in the debug
  version of raine.

* Added eeprom support and sound for Battle Bakraid. The
  ymz280b emulator was also improved, and the sound in uopoko
  is much better now.

* Stephane Humbert updated our cheats database.

Fixes in the WIP release, before 0.36 :

* demos were unreadable in 0.35b

* a segmentation fault in the nmk driver "sometimes"

18.2 Raine v0.35b

* Fixed crashes in -gamelist and in the games using the YM2610b
  sound emulation

* Fixed some more default eeproms for taito f3 games

* Elevator action 2, dariusg and dariusgx were patched so
  that they start faster and automatically reset when needed
  (when you exit service mode, or when the eeprom is regenerated).

* Elevator action 2 can now be run in 16bpp

* Removed more debug messages from bakraid (!)

* Mustang is not a clone of raiden, sorry !

* Stephane HUMBERT updated our cheats database.

18.3 RAINE v0.35a

Bug fixes :

* Logiqx fixed the bgaregc rom I had broken (sorry !)

* Stephane Humbert fixed the controls and the dipswitches
  of WWF Superstars.

* Air Gallet is now fully playable (finally !).

* Removed forgotten debuging messages from bakraid (!)

* Fixed Toki crashing at startup

* Fixed missing sound in truxton 2

* Buble Boble's screen is now correctly flashing when you
  get certain bonuses (well, let's say it's more like the
  original...).

* samesame/fire shark is now playable (without sound).

* Fixed a bug when choosing the video resolution for screens
  rotated by 270°.

* Fixed default eeproms for most cave games.

* Fixed sprites overlaping text in the end of pang3. It might
  affect other cps1 games too, but I couldn't find any other
  problem...

* Fixed a weird bug in scroll3 rendering for cps1 games when
  in 8bpp for transparant tiles.

18.4 RAINE v0.35 : QSound

This version includes a major rewrite of the z80 emulation.
As a consequence, savegames written by this version will
not be readable by older versions. The biggest changes are
for sound of course, hence the name of this version. But
first the contributors (in alphabetical order) :

* Stephane HUMBERT from the Ultimate Patchers updated the
  raine cheats database. It includes new cheats for Bakraid,
  for example...

* Stephane also fixed most of the dip switches in the toaplan2
  driver, and he found lots of bugs that I fixed later in
  this driver...

* Thanks to Liliana for the background picture of this version
  ! Also thanks to Zaxxon1 and Liliana for their help with
  the docs...

* Logiqx made many ROM changes, significantly improving compatibility
  with the MAME sets. All game names now match MAME, as
  do the ROM names and CRCs inside them. Some bad dumps
  were also identified and corrected during this task which
  should mean improved emulation. Backward ROM compatibility
  has been retained wherever possible but to clean up your
  ROM collection you should use something like ClrMamePro
  or RomCenter. (Battle Shark has much more sound now...)

* We also used the source of dz80 from Mark Incley for the
  debuger integrated in the debug version of raine (for
  developers only !)
  

Major changes :

* Added qsound support for the cps1 games which can use it.

* Fixed music tempo with a good timer emulation in batrider,
  battle garega, gunbird, sengoku ace, battle kroadj, and
  every cps1 game. This replaces the dirty hack of "fast_tp2_sound"
  of previous versions. Also, music now goes faster in Buble
  boble when you run out of time...

* Reverted to Seal for the sound emulation in the dos version,
  so pci soundcards should work better now. (Seal was used
  for the dos version in raine before 0.30). Seal is also
  the default for the win32 version now, so that soundcards
  having problems with the accelerated directx driver can
  work with raine.

* Added priorities emulation in the cps1 video emulation,
  so you don't pass through trees anymore in games like
  Cadillacs and dinosaurs... The code is not extremely fast
  yet, but it's working well. Also fixed sf2rb2 protection,
  a stupid rendering bug in the scroll3 layer, and slammasters
  is finally fully playable. Added speed hacks to most cps1
  games, and added keyboard controls to Forgotten worlds
  (Buttons 2 and 3 can be used instead of the mouse to move
  the gun - your choice. But the mouse gives better precision,
  of course).
  

Except this there are numerous fixes :

* The snapshots were not displayed correctly in resolutions
  > 640x80 or when you moved the game selection dialog.

* The mouse pointer was moving very slowly when you ran raine
  in 8bpp in a window on a 16bpp desktop (in Linux, and
  probably in windows).

* All the region codes for the xsystem2 drivers were broken
  (in games like The new zealand story, Extermination, doctor
  Toppel, Plump Pop...

* In Battle Garrega, after a few seconds in the game, there
  was a little pause. If you reset the game after this pause,
  you had a sound error.

* Music volume adjustement in Insector X (Thanks, Liliana...)

* Slight improvement of the graphics mode selection (mainly
  for linux) : when 2 modes seem equaly interesting for
  a game, choose the one with the aspect ratio closest to
  640x480.

* With Allegro sound support, add the check box "Max
  mixer volume" in sound setup. Allegro sound
  support is only used in linux now.

* Fixed the svgalib support for linux (allegro-4.0.0 broke
  it !)

* Added the coin sound to Arkanoid 2 (and clones), and the
  bug where coins were not decreasing when continuing the
  game was fixed by Stephane Humbert.

* Fixed blue sky in silkworm

* Fixed some restart positions in Bonze Adventures. The old
  file bonzchip.cfg is not necessary anymore...

* Buble boble was freezing after 20-30 minutes if left alone.

* Fixed color problems/graphics glitches in snowbros2, whoopee,
  pipibibi, and ghox, and fixed left/right keyboard controls
  in ghox.

18.5 Raine v0.34b

Added new games :

* Black Heart (nmk driver) - no sound

* Air Gallet (playable, but partial emulation only)

Fixes :

* Mustang is now playable without sound

* Fixed black screen in f3 games when changing the rom version
  code and reseting.

* Fixed bug in hiscores saving for win32 and dos.

* Fixed auto-fire... Now working again !

* Enlarged pcm buffer in pbobble3 to try to fix a weird bug
  in some win95 versions...

* Added dynamic mode lists in vbe/af (dos).

* The triple buffer hacks are back ! (for dos and linux at
  least. They are still troublesome in win32 !)

18.6 Raine v0.34a

Fixes :

* Up direction too slow in cave games

* Joystick settings not properly restored in win32 and dos

* Bad CRC for sailor moon original version (Logiqx)

* Bad romcheck for hotdogst, sailormn, sailormo, mainger

* Made music a little faster for cps1 games like ghosts and
  ghouls

* Added "fast_set_pal = 2"
  setting in raine.cfg.

18.7 RAINE v0.34 : Speed !

* Added new game : Sailor Moon.

* Added new clones : Gunbird korean version, Donpachi korean
  version, Sailor Moon original version, and battle garrega
  chinese version. All these clones are not just international
  versions : the software is really different.

* Added dynamic graphics list modes for most graphics drivers
  : vga, modex, vesa (1 to 3), svgalib, fbcon, dga2, directx
  (all fullscreen drivers). This give you every available
  mode in the Screen Setup dialog when you change the depth
  or the scanlines. This also select for you the best video
  mode available keeping your options (scanlines, pixel
  double...) for every game you load.

* Fixed music tempo and sound effects in psykio games (gunbird,
  sengoku ace, and battle k road).

* Made the music acceleration in toaplan2 games optional
  (Set fast_tp2_sound to 0 in raine.cfg if you don't like
  it)

* Added a cache for solid sprite to get a 20-30% increase
  in speed for mazinger and most toaplan2 games (batrider...).

* Added speed hacks to every cave games : a little faster
  on slow machines, and animations smoother on fast machines !

* New palette update function for 8bpp modes for Windows
  9x fullscreen modes, and linux fbcon. This function reduces
  the cpu time for palette update to 0% !

* Fixed a last bug in hiscores (hopefully !) : when loading
  a 2nd game in the gui, the hiscores of the 2nd game were
  erased !!!

* Added region codes to drtopel.

18.8 RAINE 0.33 : Rush

* New game added : Battle Bakraid, Mazinger Z.

* New clone : Kingdom Grand Prix - See Neil Corlett's site

* Added demo support, load/save by name, and compression
  in savegames (optional - see UseCompression in raine.cfg).

* Usual bugfixes...

18.9 RAINE v0.32a : bugfixes and new cheat system

What's new :

* New optional snapshots for the games. See [Snapshot]

* New cheats.cfg file format, with plenty of new cheats inside
  (thanks a lot to Steph and Pugsy). See the cheats.cfg
  file itself for an explanation of its new format.

* New cheat type : watches (usefull for puzzles)

* New linux video driver : Xwindows fullscreen.

And loads of bugfixes. Qsound games still have no sound though,
and priorities are not fixed in every cps1 game...

18.10 RAINE v0.32 : "Capcom, and the return
  of windows !" - DOS/Linux/Windows.

* Added more than 85 cps1 games and clones. Qsound games
  have no sound for now (wof, dino, punisher, slam masters,
  and mbomber).

* Full mame compatibility for the hiscore.dat file. You can
  now grab a hiscore.dat from mame, and put it directly
  in the raine directory !

* Made the gui "16bpp friendly"
  : it is now much faster in 16bpp. And added a new file
  selector...

* The windows version of raine is now much more stable !!!

18.11 RAINE v0.31a: Bug fix release

Thanks to WonderBoy (from the raine forum) for his amzing
tests !

Here is a list (maybe incomplete) of what was fixed :

* Palette problems in f3 games fixed

* Many fixes in f3 sound

* Guwange : music was stopping at the begining of game

* cave games : crash fixed for zoomed sprites out of screen

* Crash fix (palette) in :
  - Asuka And Asuka
  - Bonze's Adventure
  - Earth Joker
  - Galamedes
  - Jigoku Meguri
  - Maze Of Lott
  -All the Quiz Games (except Sekai Wa Show By Shobai): Quiz
  Chikyu Bouei Gun ; Quiz Crayon Shinchan ; Quiz Crayon
  Shinchan 2, Quiz HQ ;Quiz Jinsei Gekijoh ;Quiz Torimonochoo).

* Omega Fighter/Omega Fighter Special : the game was freezing
  after about 4s !

* V Five/Grind Stormer (only black screen)

* Kick And Run (only black screen

* Zero Wing (only sound run and black screen

* Drive Out (problem to load Rom, bad Crc message but Roms
  are OK)

* Automatically saved games had various bugs.

  from the gui

* added automatic loading of bigfont.dat when needed (640x480
  or over)

* New bonzchip.cfg allowing to finish the last level (thanks
  Stephh)

18.12 v0.31: "New Fundations"
  - Dos/Linux

This release adds mostly new graphic functions to allow almost
every driver to support 16bpp/rotation. It was done mainly
to see if f3 games would benefit from it. Apparently : not
that much, except maybe for popnpop ?

Anyway with this, and automatic rom loading, adding new drivers
should be easier now.

Since it's quiet now, and we have also included many fixes
and improvements, time was good to make a release.

Changes from Antiriad:

* Fixed memory trashing bug in layer toggle (caused crashes
  with f3 games).

* Added an option to save individual game display settings,
  but I don't like it (use save_game_screen_settings in
  raine.cfg).

* Added board numbers to all the games I have info for.

* Added cloneof information, for the rom merge tools that
  use it.

* Replaced roms/ziprom paths, now there are 4 paths, which
  are used for *both* roms and ziproms (instead of 3 for
  zipped, 3 for unzipped).

* Changed screenshot names. Now they are gamename_nnn.pcx.
  Yes, they are 'long' file names, if this is a problem
  (in real dos), see below...

* Added long_file_names switch in raine.cfg (disable for
  shrtflnm screenshots).

* Added rotation and flipping support in about 40% of games.

* Rotation options on command line/config file: -rotate n
  -no_rotate -flip n -no_flip (mame compatabilities: -rol
  -ror -flipx -flipy).

* Finally added zooming sprites in Ninja Kids, Growl (should
  of done it ages ago when I did the other games...).

* Now compiled with gcc 2.95.2 and allegro3927. Merged Sidewinder
  alt into a single driver.

Rom changes:

* tatsujn2: tsj2rom2.bin is cut from 512kb to 256kb.

* Renamed Legend of Makaj -> Legend of Makai.

Changes from Hiroshi:

* Updates to M6295/MSM5205 emulators.

* Some updates to the other sound sources too.

Changes from Spindizzy:

* Static M68705 recompiler.

* Bubble Bobble (hardware info from the mame driver by Chris
  Moore, Oliver White, Nicola Salmoria, Marco Cassili.

Changes from Antiriad:

* Added PSX pad driver for Playstation pads via LPT1/2/3.

* Added a couple more Combatribes dsw (thx mayuga). 

* Various code changes, so it compiles with msvc5.0/direct-x
  via allegro392x wi p.

* Coin Inputs are now only active for 250ms when you press
  them. This fixes the 'Coin Error' problems in Taito games
  (caused by holding the coin buttons down).

* Fixed Puchi Carat running too fast.

* Added Trackball control to Arkanoid Returns and Puchi Carat.
  Enter the test mode to enable it (or delete the eeprom
  images in savedata).

* In no gui mode, the tab key will reactivate the gui (req.
  by Bubble ).

* Replaced some sample backback with streamed channels (better
  sync in a couple of games).

* Added LED emulation to Tatsujin 2, Snow Bros 2, Whoopee,
  Knuckle Bash.

* Added -gameinfo option, prints info for games in a shark
  and mame syntax especially for frontend authors.

* Improved key names a bit (eg. 'minus' becomes '-', 'stop'
  becomes '.').

* Added new control defaults for pinball games (incase some
  more get dumped)

* Made an M6585 emulator needed by Grand Cross Pinball.

* Added year info to all the games.

* Added the 320x240 arcade monitor mode from brian lewis...
  It should work fine .

* Changed the screen selector, so that the list of resolutions
  changes depending on what gfx driver is highlighted. For
  example, it only shows 320x200 for VGA, only shows possible
  resolutions for mode-x, only shows 320x240 for arcade
  monitor... Now it is easy to see which resolutions are
  possible for each driver :).

* Added Object and BG double buffer to tnzs-system. Now the
  sprites move a lot better in Insector X and Extermination.

* Cheat info lines can be edited in the gui like the other
  cheat data.

* Moved [General] -> LanguageFile is now [Directories] ->
  language_file.

* Added [Directories] -> cheat_file.

* Renamed tripple_buffer -> triple_buffer (oops).

* Added Cheat patch type, read the info in cheats.cfg.

* Changed screen setup, so the size can be dumped.

* Fixed screen size in Darius, Ninja Warriors.

* Added led emulation to Darius, Warrior Blade.

* Cadash cutting music should be fixed.

* Added better support for rom sharing/merging, so more mame
  sets should work.

* If a rom is not found, it will search for it in the parent
  game, and if a rom is not found in the parent game, it
  will check the parent game to see if the rom is merged
  with a different filename (by searching for matching crc32
  and size data).

* Improved some bits of chase hq.

* Added starscream 0.26a. Seems to work, but I feel the new
  interrupt system might break some games... Didn't find
  any yet though.

* Fixed snow bros 2 and tatsujin 2 stalling with no sound
  selected.

18.26 v0.23: "Sidewinder release"

Changes from Antiriad:

* Added support for 12 buttons on each joystick.

* Added new default joystick settings:
  button 9 = player start (this button is the 'start' button
  on a sidewinder)
  button 10 = player coin slot (this button is the 'mode'
  button on a sidewinder).
  It's great, now I can play on raine without leaning over
  the keyboard =).

* Fixed sidewinder in allegro (added a second copy of the
  code as 'sidewinder b').
  From what I can tell, the 'sidewinder b' should function
  the same as the system16 driver...

* BIG THANKS to Paul G. for the sidewinder gamepad :).

* Added Player 3 and 4 Controls in Snow Bros 2, Hit the Ice.

* Fixed Taito Tetris romlist (2 of the listed roms were unused).

* Fixed tripple buffer interfering with frame skip radio
  buttons in gui.

* Fixed most sprite sync in Tatsujin 2.

* Fixed most priorities in Master of Weapons, Ashura Blaster.

* FG0 banking in B-System (eg. screen clear in Rambo 3, FBI
  logo in Violence Fight),

* Updated translation template.cfg (oops, forgot).

* Changed Frame Skip option in gui.

* Replaced Tripple Buffer scroll routines, so they (should)
  work with vbe/af.

* Added Combatribes player 3 controls and dsw to activate
  them (thx mayuga).

* Changed TNZS guide url in cheats.txt (thx chris).

Non Changes:

* We didn't publically add any new games since 0.22.

* We didn't make any modifications to the Chase HQ emulation.

18.27 v0.22: "Chase HQ release"

Changes from Hiromitsu Shioya:

* Updated all sound emulators, updated sound playback system.

* Fixed Darius object - bg1 priority.

Changes from Antiriad:

* Fixed Maze of Flott FG0 scroll typo (maybe fixes some other
  games too).

* Fixed Arkanoid 2 buttons and reset bug on nzs-system games.

* Fixed Insector X level 2 bug, renamed to insectx because
  of mame (was insectrx).

* Added a pixel double option in raine.cfg (for NaMcO's dodgy
  monitor).

* Added some alternate search modes (see the cheating section[Cheat Searching]). 

* Converted about 15 games to slightly slower colour mapping/tile
  drawing, now no games need vsync to be enabled, and the
  vsync autodetect option is gone.

* Removed any listed resolutions where Y < 200. You can still
  select these from raine.cfg, but they aren't much use,
  so they are undocumented.

* Made palette code keep colours locked for 3 frames instead
  of 2, I think this is necessary for tripple buffer on
  some slow gfx cards?

* Keys now move around the load game list (eg. 's' to jump
  to saint dragon).

* Fixed Toki continue dsw.

* Type raine -romcheck to check all games, and raine -romcheck
  to check a single game (output is in romcheck.txt).

* Added mame tripple buffer scroll routine, which is a hack
  of allegro's vesa_scroll, it does not behave well with
  all gfx modes (vesa3 is good vbe/af is not always good).

* Added Sega ISA joystick driver. Does it work? Nobody knows...

* Added memory hex view window when you double click on cheat
  search results.

* Changed M6295 interface, since Bomb Jack Twin has many
  rom banks.

* Added crc32 and file size info for all roms (too many req's).

* Added multiple rom directory names, also with long file
  names :).

* Expanded Load Error messages, they are in a scrollable
  text box now.

* 100% decoded Bomb Jack Twin gfx roms.

* Game list mode is saved in raine.cfg (requested by some
  ppl)

* Added fast_set_pal in raine.cfg. 1 = Use faster colour
  loading (raine 0.20). 0 = Use slower colour loading (raine
  0.18; compatible with more cards). Default is 1.

* Added Autofire setup in gui. Try using a test mode (eg.
  mega blast) to test it out :). Autofire settings are not
  saved, should they be?

* Gui font is proportional, except in listboxes, where it
  makes sense to be non -prop.

* Scanlines are now black in Rainbow Islands.

* Fixed Cheat engine for Z80 games. Tested with TNZS, Raimais,
  Fighting Hawk.

* Impossible Joystick positions are now prevented. So, you
  can press up or down, but you cannot press up and down
  simultaneously, etc... Fixes some bugs, like on Ninja
  Warriors, pressing left, right and up all together caused
  bad stuff to happen to the main player.

* Added default joys and a default joys editor, works like
  the keyboard stuff.

* Added led emulation to Darius 2 and Ninja Warriors.

* Fixed wrong joystick buttons for player 2 in space gun
  and op thunder.

* Added default keys and a default keys editor. Changed all
  game drivers.

* Fixed Dinorex lockups, caused by bad programming in the
  rom, leaving trash in some bits of the address registers.

* Made Action Replay cheat names max 256 chars.

* Added file selector option when setting zip/rom dirs.

* Added some game info window, with some company logos.

* Added button 3 in Violence Fight, 6 buttons in Kaiser Knuckle.

* Added some dsw from Thomas Pitt..

* Fixed Load Game when the game list selection is empty and
  you click load game.

* Fixed Snow Bros 2 missing sound.

Note: Insector X had to be removed because we found a last

* Added a vsync autodetect option, which will only vsync
  when a game uses a direct mapper and the palette is really
  changed.

* Busy mouse sprite, from _iceball_.

19 Lists of boards

19.1 TAITO BOARD LIST - Vixen, Antiriad & Raine Team

This list is mainly to identify all Taito hardware, each
Taito machine has an ordered number from 1983 onwards. It
is not a list of dumped Taito romsets, some of these are
undumped.

Probably other Taito hardware is also numbered this way.

Please send any extra info.

Thanks to J-Rom, araCORN, Raven, malcor, David Jorge, Al
Kossow, Soren Svendsen for information. This list has been
hugely ipmroved by vixen! Thanks!! :)

The change of the title that differs by country wrote to
the same line. It distinguished it as the different game,
in the case that there is an obvious new version.

Product listing of TAITO begins from here.

20 List of supported games

See section "Games" in http://www.rainemu.com/

21 Disclaimer

21.1 Distribution

1. You may not distribute modified versions of the raine package.
  This means you must not remove any files, or add any files
  (especially not rom images).

2. You are encouraged to spread raine as you wish. However,
  you must not sell it in any way:
  If you wish to put it on a www site, that is ok, as long
  as there are not too many advert banners, misleading links,
  or other scams.
  If you wish to distribute it on a magnetic medium such
  as floppy disk or cd-rom, you must not charge more than
  the cost of the media and the packaging.

21.2 Rom Ownership

In most countries, it is illegal to own rom images for arcade
games, unless you own the original arcade board too. Therefore,
downloading roms for games you do not own is illegal and
they should be deleted within 24 hours.
