------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         SECTION 1     Basic Instructions on enabling cheats in MAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Since the MAME 0.147 cheat collection release the cheat.zip has been
      replaced with cheat.7z so you should move or delete the cheat.zip file
      from your MAME directory.

What to do with the cheat.7z file :-

Step 1 (what to do with the cheat.7z file )
===========================================

First of all do NOT unpack the cheat.7z file - it will work just fine as a 7z,
it contains over 118,000 xml files so unpacking it is not advised.

First of all unzip or copy the cheat.7z file into the same directory
that contains MAME EXE File. (All platforms apart from Mac OS 9/X ).

For MacMAME the cheat.7z file should be in:-
${HOME}/Documents/MacMAME User Data/Misc Support Files

For MAME OS X (not SDLMAME OSX!) the cheat.7z file should be in:-
${HOME}/Library/Application Support/MAME OS X


Step 2 (Enable the MAME Cheat Engine)
=====================================

As standard the MAME Cheat Engine is turned OFF, there are several ways of
turning it ON depending on which platform you are running MAME on.

MAME:  This is the standard MAME command line compile, go to your MAME
        directory open up the MAME.INI file with a text editor (the one you
        are using to read this will probably do!).
          Find '### Mame CORE misc options ###' and change 'cheat 0' to
        'cheat 1'. If you have no INI file then just start MAME from the
        command-line with the -createconfig option  eg. 'MAME -createconfig'.
        If you manually use MAME every time from the command-line you can also
        just add '-cheat' to the command line.

MAMEUI: This is the MAME with build in frontend compile for Windows. Go to
        the Options Menu, and select "Default Options". Go to the
        Miscellaneous tab and check the box that says "Enable Game Cheats".

DMAME:  This is the DOS MAME compile, go to your MAME directory open up the
        MAME.CFG file with a text editor (the one you are using to read this
        will probably do!).
          Find 'cheat off' and change it to 'cheat on'. If you have no CFG file
        then just start MAME from the command-line with the -createconfig
        option eg. 'MAME -createconfig'. If you manually use MAME every time
        from the command-line you can also just add '-cheat' to the
        command-line.

UNIX:   For the UNIX/LINUX compiles just follow the instructions for DMAME
        the DOS compile.

OS9/X:  From the front-end, go to the Misc tab, and check the box that says
        "Allow Cheats" or "Enable Cheats".


Step 3 (Cheat!)
===============

In-game press TAB and follow your nose......
Left and Right cursor toggles cheats ON and OFF, ENTER turns on one shot cheats
and SPACE displays the cheat comments if there are any (the comments will auto
display as you move up/down to a cheat with any comments for a short time).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 SECTION 2     Cheat Description Meanings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL NOTES ABOUT CHEAT DESCRIPTIONS AND WHAT THEY MEAN:
----------------------------------------------------------
NOTES: The cheat descriptions use the following terms, this is what they
       actually mean:

Get+Now! means the cheat is a type 00000001 cheat and so it is a temporary cheat -
         it changes the memory and then deactivates. Type 01 is ideal for
         getting a particular weapon or feature, also needed for a Finish
         Level Now! cheat.

Always   means the cheat is permanent (several cheat types) idea for always
         having a certain weapon or feature eg always have 3 rainbows on
         Rainbow Islands.

Infinite means exactly what it says - you will have an inexhaustible supply of
         the named item be it lives, time, ammo or something else. On some
         rare occasions you may need to deactivate the cheat before you can
         finish a level, if this need to be done you will see F6 at the end
         of the cheat description.

Select current level  - Select a level and you can progress to it by losing a
                        life. You should only activate this type of cheat
                        during game play or according to the comments.

Select next level - Select a level and when you complete the current level you
                    will progress straight to the selected level. You can also
                    activate this on the title/attract screens though the
                    effects cannot always be guaranteed! (you will either
                    start on the selected level or the next level after the
                    selected one or level 1). A far better method if you want
                    to select the starting level from the title screen is to
                    use the method that I thought of for Metrocross. See
                    Metrocross remarks for info.

Select Score - This cheat allows you to select your score or/and the other
               player's score, ideal for sports games where you need a certain
               score to win and/or progress. It must ONLY be activated during
               game play. Also note the score may not display correctly until
               the score has changed properly!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       SECTION 3     Cheat Ordering
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how I order the cheats - I try and stick to it as often as I can.
Some games don't conform to this standard either because it's better as is or
the cheats were done a while ago and I haven't changed them. DO NOT report any
games that don't follow this standard - it's pretty low on the list of
priorities right now.

OVERALL CHEAT ORDER
-------------------

gamename in format '; [ long game name ]'
section1
section2
section3 (if applicable)
section4

WHAT'S EACH SECTION ABOUT?
--------------------------

Section 1 contains all the cheats valid for all players. Infinite Credits will
come first normally.

Section 2 contains cheats for individual players, split up so that all P1
cheats are together and all P2 cheats are together. Normally there will be the
same cheats for each player and the order of the cheats should be the same as
for the other player.

Section 3 contains cheats that are hard to button-hole and have fairly obscure
effects on the game that only the die-hard player of that game may really want.
These sort of cheats can often be merged into section 2, though in some
circumstances the sheer number of these cheats will seriously clutter out the
normal everyday cheats (section 2). In that case they should be separated into
another section and the P1 / P2 separation in that section should be maintained
if possible.

Section 4 contains any none cheat related things. Eg. Sound test timer and region
switch  codes.

WHAT'S IN EACH SECTION
----------------------

The normal order of cheats will be if there is no P1 or P2 specific cheats.
If a cheat is specific to all players it will promote it up the list.

Infinite Credits
Infinite Time       (if 'Finish this Round Now!' is worthwhile it should
                     directly follow this cheat)
Infinite Lives
Infinite Energy     (if 'Drain all Energy Now!' is worthwhile it should
                     directly follow this cheat)
Infinite Ammo
Infinite Bombs
Invincibility       (if Invincibility doesn't turn off after a short while of
                     disabling it then there should be separate 'ON' and 'OFF'
                     cheats)
Always have this weapon
Get this weapon Now!
Play with this character Now!
Select starting level
Select current level
Select next level

SPACING/BLANK COMMENTS
----------------------

Blank Comment cheats should be added to improve the readability of the cheats
in the cheat engine were appropriate.

There should be a blank after section 1 if section 2 has 3 or more cheat entries
for each player OR if section 1 has itself got three or more cheat entries.

If there are 3 or more cheat entries for each player in section 2 then the
entries for each player should be separated with a blank comment.

If section 3 exists it should ideally be preceded by a blank comment.

If section 4 exists it should ideally be preceded by a blank comment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SECTION 4     Cheat Engine Commands (to customise the cheat UI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cheat engine has been radically changed, this section is no longer
applicable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  SECTION 5     Cheat Format Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cheat engine has been radically changed, the cheat format that was here is
no longer applicable. Information about the new format may follow some time in
the future.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              SECTION 6     How to Pre-Enable cheats
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cheat engine has been radically changed, the method that was given here is
no longer applicable. There is no time-line for a new method of doing this,
although it could theoretically be a LOT easier with the XML-based cheat engine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   SECTION 7     Dynamic Cheat Finding method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This method is from 2000(-2002) so the cheat engine/cheat format and the
      debugger used at that time has long gone so use this for reference only.

Dynamic Cheat Finding method by Pugsy
-------------------------------------

From the start, this is presuming you are using a debug MAME. I'm using samsho2
as an example and I am looking for Infinite Energy for PL1 - the method is easy
to alter for different games and/or other things (this is mainly a method used
for neogeo games - the only real system that utilises dynamic addressing for
'useful' locations). It's not a method for beginners, it assumes cheat finding
skills, a basic understanding of hexadecimal addressing and an ability to
decode my waffling.


1. Start MAME as you would normally - don't forget you must use the debug MAME
   build with either -debug on the command-line or DEBUG 1 in the ini file.

2. You will find that after a short while MAME will be on the debugger screen,
   at this stage just press F12 to start the game. [REMEMBER F12 in the
   debugger will return you to the game]

3. Commence play

4. Start a Energy Search and reduce the results using standard methods. In the
   example I reduced the results to 2 possibles 100AC6 & 10373B, by using
   watches I can discount 100AC6 as it's the time location. So that leaves us
   with 10373B 80 = Full Energy. NOTE: You have to find the value as quickly as
   possible because the location will change the next time the level changes,
   so you would have to start the search from the beginning. You can test the
   address you find by poking it directly if it's the correct location you will
   find it will have the desired affect on that level.

5. Press the tilde key (the tilde key is the key under Esc and about TAB and
   the the left of 1). You will now be in the debugger, remember the fact that
   we found the address 0010373B in step 4 (Note the preceding 0s - we will
   need them).

6. Press TAB 3 times so that the cursor is in the address window. Now press S
   to commence a search and type in the value as per step 5...but drop the last
   byte as that will be part of the index. So in this case we would type in 00
   10 37, then press RETURN to execute the search - you can repeat the search
   by  pressing S and hitting RETURN (the last search values are still set).
   For every search result note down the address, you can safely ignore any
   results in ROM locations or where it crosses word boundaries (ie. it shows as
   XX00 1037 instead of 0010 37XX). In this example you will find that
   S 00 10 37  only returns one ROM location at 00003680, so we can safely
   ignore it. However, there are no other occurrences so we are goosed.....or
   are we?

7. If there are no possibilities then remember that the location we are looking
   for contains an address that hopefully points to a page of memory limited in
   size. In most cases this seems to be no greater than 256 bytes and is mostly
   forward indexed (+ve rather than -ve). So assuming that 10373B is the
   extreme case it is 256 bytes away from the start of the memory page base
   location, then the base location of the page would be 10363C. So we need to
   repeat Step 6 but this time with S 00 10 36 as the search instruction,
   ignoring ROM locations and word boundary crossing, from this we get the
   following results:-

   Address     Contents
   100A46       00103680
   100A5E       00103680
   102AEC       00103680
   102D2C       00103680
   103F2C       00103680
   10404C       00103680
   104DCC       00103680
   10500C       00103680
   1057EC       00103680
   105A2C       00103680
   105C6C       00103680
   10644C       00103680

8. From the Step 7 results you can see that all the results point to a page of
   memory starting at 00103680, since we know the energy location is 0010373B
   we can work out that the index value is = BB (Cheat Location - Start Address
   of page = 10373B -103680).

9. Now you need to narrow the location down either by loads of watches on
   several levels or by excessive testing, personally I place a watch on all
   the locations and try the first location first, second location second etc
   etc. [ NOTE: A lot of neogeo games which utilise dynamic addressing seem to
   like to use a value in the range 100AXX as the pointer location. ] Here are
   the cheats to try first...

   :samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 1]
   :samsho2:83000000:00100A5E:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 2]
   :samsho2:83000000:00102AEC:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 3]
   :samsho2:83000000:00102D2C:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 4]

   { One more interesting thing to note, you may find that several locations
     will have the desired affect as the pointers maybe held in several places
     in memory, it really doesn't matter which one you use. }

10. Once you find out the location which works bear in mind that the game will
    use the same page for other things like Power etc, Note PL2 will generally
    use a different page though the location holding the pointer is generally
    right next to the pointer for the other Player (the index will generally be
    the same though...which is nice :) ).

For samsho2 we hence have these dynamic cheats:-

:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1
:samsho2:83000001:00100A46:00000000:000000BB:Drain All Energy Now! PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000020:000000F0:Always have Maximum Power PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000000:000000F0:Always have Minimum Power PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL2
:samsho2:83000001:00100A4A:00000000:000000BB:Drain All Energy Now! PL2
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000020:000000F0:Always have Maximum Power PL2
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000000:000000F0:Always have Minimum Power PL2

             SECTION 9     Games utilising ROM cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Games utilising ROM cheats, where the cheat actually changes the program code
rather than the game data. Individual credits will be given due to the extra
work and skill - though only for cheats where RAM cheats are either not
possible or buggy! Sometimes it is actually a LOT quicker to make a ROM hack
than find a RAM cheat.

I'm keeping this list as I may find it useful to for testing purposes when the
cheat engine changes...especially for processors with endian (big and little)
issues. As new clones are added I will add the cheats and give credit to the
original author for the clones as long as the conversions are relatively
straightforward and there's not a whole lot of ROM cheats to convert at the
time!

   SECTION 10     Games utilising EEPROM/Mapped Memory cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of games that currently make use of cheats that poke direct to
mapped memory or EEPROM. Generally these cheats are to reveal game functions
such as hidden game characters. Note: If the mapped memory being poked is
actually program code it is classed as a ROM cheat!

       SECTION 11     Games utilising Forced Range cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of the games currently make use of the force range type cheat as
added in the new cheat engine. It basically allows you to take a location and
make sure that the value stays within a range of values. An example is Arkanoid
where by finding the Y pos of the ball sprite we can ensure by a simple cheat
that the ball never leaves the playing area as soon as it attempts to we poke
the location with a value which will effectively push the ball up a bit so that
you can have another go at hitting the ball. They will hopefully used more in
future as people understand them.

SECTION 12   Games utilising Dynamic (Relative Addressing) cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of games that currently use 'dynamic' cheats. Dynamic cheats
are basically just relative addressed cheats. The problem with some games when
you do a cheat search is that you can easily find for example the energy
location and poking it will seem to work fine, but if you advance a level you
will find that the cheat no longer works. In fact the next time you play the
level you found the cheat for you will probably find that the cheat doesn't
work there either. I've included my method of how to find your own 'dynamic'
cheats under this list...enjoy ;-) Again this list is sorted in the order that
cheats were added (oldest cheats first).

              SECTION 13     Games which may use the same cheats
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Basically this is an alphabetical list of clones, so even although area88
 is a clone of UN Sqauadron it is listed after area88. Also some of the
 games are not listed by MAME as clones but they are, at least from the
 perspective of cheats - which is why this is here!

 =  means the game uses the same cheats as the game listed before it.

 ~  means the game uses slightly different cheats than the game listed
    before it.

 ~= means the game uses cheats which are the same AND some are slightly
    different than the game listed before it

   This list of clones will always be based on the latest version of MAME
   be it a BETA or a FINAL release that is covered by the cheat file!!
   Almost inevitably this clone list will contain errors, due to the nature
   of it being updated as an afterthought and being manually updated.

   If there are cheats for non-working clones (and so they are untested)
   then a comment should be added to that effect in this list so that the
   game entry need not have untested in it, in most cases clones will work

   This list of clones is only valid for RAM cheats - ROM cheats and dip
   switches vary too frequently between games.

       SECTION 14     Games which currently have no cheats with reason
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following games do not yet have cheats (Infinite Credits does NOT count as
a proper cheat) for at least one of the following reasons (not all reasons will be
used at any one time):-

1.  The game has not yet been properly emulated by MAME or it crashes when
    I try to play it :-(. Some games which are broken still have cheats -
    however, if it's NOT properly emulated and no good cheats could be found
    then reason 1 will be quoted over all other reasons (apart from 3 & 6).
    I also use this reason if I can't figure out the control method or it's
    too awkward for me to waste time figuring out. There are LOTs of 'reason 1'
    and they will not get checked again till they get reported as working.

2.  I don't know what cheats to find as the game is hard to understand and is
    perhaps in a another tongue - eg Japanese (not including Mahjong games though).
    Or the the game doesn't appear suitable for cheat finding.

3.  This is a Mahjong/Hanafuda game - I don't do Mahjong games. I'll leave cheat
    finding on these games to other people. In fact if the game's got Mahjong in
    the title, this reason will be quoted above all others apart maybe from reason 1.

4.  I've got cheat(s) for the game but I haven't had chance to test them or redo
    the cheat description(s).

5.  The game was added or fixed in one of the last versions and I haven't had chance
    to find any cheats yet. If there is no reason quoted, then it is for this
    reason.

6.  It appears to be gambling or a redemption ticket game, and although cheats are
    possible they generate little interest. I'm sure if computers had payout bins
    there would be more cheats....

7.  I've had a quick look at this game and it seems suitable for cheat finding,
    there's maybe RAM set up, although RAM banking may make RAM searching impossible.
    but even a simple search for an Infinite Lives cheat
    didn't turn up any cheats after whittling down the locations.... These can
    be taken as a challenge!!!

8.  Although it is possible to find cheats for this game, unfortunately the cheats
    are not constant. IE The next time you load the game (or even reset it) the
    cheat locations will have changed. This effects a LOT of games, occasionally it
    is possible to find the odd cheat though as some locations maybe constant. This
    dynamic memory location problem is quite prevalent in neo-geo fighter games - and
    there maybe some cheats in the cheat file that don't work and this will be the most
    likely cause. Relative Address (dynamic memory) Cheats can be often be found for
    these but it involves a bit more time to find them, this has been put on the backburner.

9.  This game hasn't got any cheats, however there is a clone or parent of this game
	which has cheats. It may just need a straight copy of the cheats.

10. Nobody has submitted any cheats for this game and I am so sick and tired of this
    genre I can't motivate myself to find any cheats for this game. However, I
    would expect it to be any easy game to find cheats for and you only have to look
    at games of the same genre to find out which cheats can be found (eg. for baseball
    games look at another baseball game).

11. I haven't had chance to look at the game for one reason or another -
    A COP OUT! ;-) I may have had a look at the game in the past but I can't
    remember - I will use this reason in that case too. I'll only use this reason
    if none of the other reasons fit. Expect to see this reason a lot if the cheat
    file doesn't get updated often enough.

12. This game requires a large chd (eg. Dragon's Lair which requires a massive lossless chd
    conversion of the laserdisc). The game may or may not work but the size of the chd is a
    massive hinderance - the availabilty & obtainability may also be an issue. BUT PLEASE
    DON'T POST/EMAIL ANY LINKS TO ANY OF THE FILES - if you have all the files required and
    the game works and you want to help then please find the cheats and post them on the
    cheat forums.

13. This is a mechanical game (eg pinball), cheats may be added for some of these in future
    releases if they prove to be suitable.
	
14. This non-arcade system has been added during the amalgamation of MESS into MAME. If the 
    system has games included in the softwarelist then cheats may well appear in the future. 
    Currently there are a few issues that preclude cheat functionality for this system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              SECTION 15     General list of work to be done
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall:-
----------
Fix any flickering invincibility cheats to stop the flickering using ROM cheats [AS AND WHEN]
Convert single byte multi-part cheats to poke 2,4 bytes [AS AND WHEN]
Convert cheats that are poking the same location into list cheats  + poss. dropping Now! duplicated cheats [AS AND WHEN]
Reduce number of <action>s in Mahjong cheats with one base address - see mhgaiden as an example [AS AND WHEN]

Specific:-
----------

Don't expect this list to change too much - there's more pressing issues for
me to deal with normally - I do have a crack at them occasionally.

Look at replicating Mania Challenge cheats for The Main Event
More codes for 88 Games
Body Slam - room for lots more cheats, see other wrestling games for possible cheats
More cheats for Big Pro Wrestling! needed
Ultraman look at cheats and check....problems encountered
Duplicate ROM Invincibility cheats from cloak for the agentx prototypes
Duplicate nolberto82's move manually cheat for the remaining pacman/puckman clnes:-
    39in1, 4in1, abscam, ctrpllrp, hangly, hangly2, hangly3, jrpacmbl, mschamp, mschamps, newpuc2,
    newpuc2b, pacplus, piranha, piranhao & puckmanh
Update ROM Invincibility from mhavoc for mhavoc2, mhavocp, alphaonea, alphaone
Lots of ROM cheats from nolberto82 and Abystus to be replicated for clones
Update this text file so that it contains more info/credits about the software list games added in the MAME 0.163 release.
