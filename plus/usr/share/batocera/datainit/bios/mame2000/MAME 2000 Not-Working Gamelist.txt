The meanings of the columns are as follows:
Working - "No" means that the emulation has shortcomings that cause the game
  not to work correctly. This can be anywhere from just showing a black screen
  to being playable with major problems.
Correct Colors - "Yes" means that colors should be identical to the original,
  "Close" that they are very similar but wrong in places, "No" that they are
  completely wrong. In some cases, we were not able to find the color PROMs of
  the game. Those PROMs will be reported as "NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN" on startup,
  and the game will have wrong colors. The game is still reported as "Yes" in
  this column, because the code to handle the color PROMs is in the driver and
  if you provide them colors will be correct.
Sound - "Partial" means that sound support is either incomplete or not entirely
  accurate. Note that, due to analog circuitry which is difficult to emulate,
  sound may be significantly different from the real board. A common case is
  the presence of low pass filters that make the real board sound less harsh
  than the emulation.
Screen Flip - A large number of games have a dip switch setting for "Cocktail"
  cabinet, meaning that the players sit in front of each other, and the screen
  is flipped when player 2 is playing. Some games also have a "Flip Screen" dip
  switch. Those need special support in the driver, which is missing in many
  cases.
Internal Name - This is the unique name that should be specified on the command
  line to run the game. ROMs must be placed in the ROM path, either in a .zip
  file or in a subdirectory of the same name. The former is suggested, because
  the files will be identified by their CRC instead of requiring specific
  names.
